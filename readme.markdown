TODO:

* make abbreviation filter use blaze html instead of strings
* fix tags/categories
* fix images
* add archive with year prepended if not current year (use metadata to group? look at recentFirst)
* make the abbreviation filter into a pandoc transformer?
  * collect abbreviations in its pass
  * substitute abbreviations in pandoc transformer?
