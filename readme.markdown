This is the source for my [personal site](http://blaenkdenum.com).

Features:

* abbreviation support. abbreviations are defined as `*[GHC]: Glasgow Haskell Compiler`
* pygments highlighting of codeblocks with caching
* table of contents generation with pretty section numbers
* blockquotes with pretty borders
* atom feed generation

Todo:

* possible optimization for pygments: combine all similar language code blocks into one "file"
