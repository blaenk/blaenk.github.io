  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve been wanting to learn about the subject of machine learning for a while now. I’m familiar with some basic concepts, as well as reinforcement learning. What follows are notes on my attempt to comprehend the subject. The primary learning resource I’m using is Cal Tech’s CS 1156 on edX, with supplementary material from Stanford’s CS 229 on Coursera.</p>
<p>I pushed my code for the programming assignments for this class to <a href="https://github.com/blaenk/learning-from-data">github</a>.</p>

<h1 id="learning-problem">Learning Problem</h1>
<p>The essence of machine learning:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>pattern exists</li>
<li>cannot pin it down mathematically</li>
<li>have data on it to learn from</li>
</ol>
<p>A movie recommender system might be modeled such that there are a set of factors of varying degrees of likability for the viewer, and varying degrees of presence in a given movie. These two sets of factors combine to produce a projected viewer rating for that given movie.</p>
<p>The machine learning aspect would take an actual user rating, and given two contributing-factor vectors for the movie and viewer full of random factors, it would modify each until a rating similar to the actual user rating is produced.</p>

<ul>
<li>The set of candidate hypotheses where <span class="math">\(g \in \cal H\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Together, <span class="math">\(\cal A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\cal H\)</span> are known as the <em>learning model</em>.</p>
<h2 id="perceptrons">Perceptrons</h2>
<h3 id="perceptron-model">Model</h3>
<p>Given input <span class="math">\(\def \feature {\mathbf x} \feature = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\text {approve} &amp;\colon \sum_{i=1}^{d} w_i x_i &gt; \text {threshold} \\
\text {deny}    &amp;\colon \sum_{i=1}^{d} w_i x_i &lt; \text {threshold}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>This can be expressed as a linear formula <span class="math">\(h \in \cal H\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\newcommand{sign}{\operatorname{sign}}
h(x) = \sign \left( \left( \sum_{i=1}^{d} w_i x_i \right) - \text {threshold} \right)
\]</span></p>
<p>The factors that are varied to determine the hypothesis function are the weights and threshold.</p>
<p>The threshold can be represented as a weight <span class="math">\(w_0\)</span> if an artificial constant <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> is added to the feature vector where <span class="math">\(x_0 = 1\)</span>. This simplifies the formula to:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ h(x) = \sign \left( \sum_{i=0}^{d} w_i x_i \right) \]</span></p>
<p>This operation is the same as the dot product of the two vectors:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\def \weight {\mathbf w}
\def \weightT {\weight^\intercal}
h(x) = \sign(\weight \bullet \feature)
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="perceptron-learning-algorithm">Learning Algorithm</h3>
<p><strong>Given the perceptron</strong>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ h(x) = \sign(\weight \bullet \feature) \]</span></p>
<p><strong>Given the training set</strong>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\feature = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Pick a misclassified point</strong>. A point is misclassified if the perceptron’s output doesn’t match the recorded data’s output given an input vector:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \sign(w \bullet x_n) \not= y_n \]</span></p>
<p><strong>Update the weight vector</strong>: The algorithm must correct for this by updating the weight vector.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \weight&#39; \gets \weight + y_n x_n \]</span></p>
<p>Visualizing <span class="math">\(\vec w\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\vec x\)</span>, it’s apparent that the perceptron is equivalent to the dot product, which is equivalent to <span class="math">\(\cos \theta\)</span> where <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> is the angle between <span class="math">\(\vec w\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\vec x\)</span>. Given this, <span class="math">\(\vec w\)</span> is updated depending on what the intended result <span class="math">\(y_n\)</span> is.</p>
<p>For example, if the perceptron modeled the result to be <span class="math">\(-1\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(\theta &gt; 90^\circ\)</span>. However, if the intended result <span class="math">\(y_n = +1\)</span>, then there is a mismatch, so the weight vector is “nudged” in the correct direction so that <span class="math">\(\theta &lt; 90^\circ\)</span> by adding it to <span class="math">\(x_n\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-learning">Types of Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supervised learning</strong>: when the input/output data is provided</li>
<li><strong>Unsupervised learning</strong>: only the input is provided; “unlabeled data”</li>
<li><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong>: input and <em>some</em> output is provided</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="feasibility">Feasibility</h1>
<p>It seems as if it isn’t feasible to learn an unknown function because the function can assume any value outside of the data available to us.</p>
<p>To understand why it is indeed possible, consider a probabilistic example. Given a bin full of marbles that are either <strong>red</strong> or <strong>green</strong>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
&amp;P \left( \text {picking a red marble} \right) = \mu \\
\\
&amp;P \left( \text {picking a green marble} \right) = 1 - \mu \\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>If the value of <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> is unknown, and we pick <span class="math">\(N\)</span> marbles independently, then:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \text {frequency of red marbles in sample} = \nu \]</span></p>
<p>The question is: does <span class="math">\(\nu\)</span> say anything about <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span>? It might appear that it <strong>doesn’t</strong>. For example, if there are 100 marbles in the bin and only 10 of them are red, just because we happen to take out all 10 (<span class="math">\(\nu = 1\)</span>) doesn’t mean that that sample is representative of the distribution in the bin (<span class="math">\(\mu = 1\)</span>).</p>
<p>However, in a <strong>big sample</strong>, it’s more probable that <span class="math">\(\nu\)</span> is close to <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span>, that is, they are within <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> of each other. This can be formally expressed as <em>Hoeffding’s Inequality</em>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
P \left( \left| \nu - \mu \right| \gt \epsilon \right) \leq 2e^{- 2\epsilon^2 N}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\(\nu\)</span> is generally varied, and <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> is a constant.</p>
<p>As is apparent from the inequality, if we choose a very small <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> value, it has the effect of setting the right-hand side to near 1, thus rendering the effort pointless since we already knew that the probability would be <span class="math">\(\leq 1\)</span>. <strong>Therefore</strong>, if we want a smaller <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span>, we will have to increase the input size <span class="math">\(N\)</span> to compensate.</p>
<p>The appeal of Hoeffding’s Inequality is that it is valid for any <span class="math">\(N \in \mathbb {Z}^+\)</span> and any <span class="math">\(\epsilon &gt; 0\)</span>. What we’re trying to say with the inequality is that <span class="math">\(\nu \approx \mu\)</span> which means that <span class="math">\(\mu \approx \nu\)</span>.</p>
<p>This relates to learning in the following way. In the bin, <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> is unknown, but in learning the unknown is the target function <span class="math">\(f \colon \mathcal {X} \to \mathcal {Y}\)</span>. Now think of the bin as the input space, where every marble is a point <span class="math">\(x \in \mathcal {X}\)</span> such as a credit application. As a result, the bin is really <span class="math">\(\mathcal {X}\)</span>, where the marbles are of different colors such as green and gray, where:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>green</strong> represents that the hypothesis got it right, that is <span class="math">\(h(x) = f(x)\)</span></li>
<li><strong>red</strong> represents that the hypothesis got it wrong, that is <span class="math">\(h(x) \not= f(x)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>However, in creating this analogy from the bin example to the learning model, the bin example has a probability component in picking a marble from the bin. This must be mapped to the learning model as well, in the form of introducing a probability distribution <span class="math">\(P\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(P\)</span> is not restricted over <span class="math">\(\mathcal {X}\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(P\)</span> doesn’t have to be known. It is then assumed that the probability is used to generate the input data points.</p>
<p>The problem so far is that the hypothesis <span class="math">\(h\)</span> is fixed, and for a given <span class="math">\(h\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\nu\)</span> generalizes to <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span>, which ends up being a <em>verification</em> of <span class="math">\(h\)</span>, not learning.</p>
<p>Instead, to make it a learning process, then there needs to be no guarantee that <span class="math">\(\nu\)</span> will be small, and we need to choose from multiple <span class="math">\(h\)</span>’s. To generalize the bin model to more than one hypothesis, we can use multiple bins. Out of the many bins that were created, the hypothesis responsible for the bin with the smallest <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span>—the fraction of red marbles in the bin—is chosen.</p>
<h2 id="notation-for-learning">Notation</h2>
<p>Both <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\nu\)</span> depend on which hypothesis <span class="math">\(h\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\nu\)</span> is the error <em>in sample</em>, which is denoted by <span class="math">\(\def \insample {E_{\text {in}}} \insample(h)\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> is the error <em>out of sample</em>, which is denoted by <span class="math">\(\def \outsample {E_{\text {out}}} \outsample(h)\)</span></p>
<p>For clarification, if something performs well “out of sample” then it’s likely that learning actually took place. This notation can be used to modify Hoeffding’s Inequality:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
P \left( \left|\insample(h) - \outsample(h)\right| \gt \epsilon \right) \leq 2e^{- 2\epsilon^2 N}
\]</span></p>
<p>The problem now is that Hoeffding’s Inequality doesn’t apply to multiple bins. To account for multiple bins, the inequality can be modified to be:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align*}
P \left( \left|\insample(g) - \outsample(g)\right| \gt \epsilon \right) &amp;\leq
P \begin{aligned}[t]
              \left( \vphantom {\epsilon} \right. &amp;\hphantom {\text {or}}\
                \left|\insample(h_1) - \outsample(h_1)\right| \gt \epsilon \\
              &amp;\text {or}\ \left|\insample(h_2) - \outsample(h_2)\right| \gt \epsilon \\
              &amp;\dots \\
              &amp;\left. \vphantom{\insample(h_1)} \text {or}\ \left|\insample(h_M) - \outsample(h_M)\right| \gt \epsilon \right)
            \end{aligned} \\
&amp;\leq \sum_{m=1}^M P \left( \left| \insample(h_m) - \outsample(h_m) \right| &gt; \epsilon \right) \\
&amp;\leq \sum_{m=1}^M 2e^{- 2\epsilon^2 N} \\
P \left( \left|\insample(g) - \outsample(g)\right| \gt \epsilon \right) &amp;\leq 2Me^{- 2\epsilon^2 N}
\end{align*}

However, if an example digit is a 16x16 bitmap, then that corresponds to an array of 256 real numbers, which becomes 257 when <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> is added for the threshold. This means the problem is operating in 257 dimensions.</p>
<p>Instead, the input can be represented in just three dimensions: <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span>, intensity, and symmetry. The intensity corresponds to how many black pixels exist in the example, and the symmetry is a measure of how symmetric the digit is along the x and y axes. See slide 5 to see a plot of the data using these features.</p>
<h2 id="pocket-algorithm">Pocket Algorithm</h2>
<p>The <abbr title="Perceptron Learning Algorithm">PLA</abbr> would never converge on non-linearly separable data, so it’s common practice to forcefully terminate it after a certain number of iterations. However, this has the consequence that the hypothesis function ends up being whatever the result of the last iteration was. This is a problem because it could be that a better hypothesis function with lower in-sample error <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> was discovered in a previous iteration.</p>
<p>The Pocket algorithm is a simple modification to the <abbr title="Perceptron Learning Algorithm">PLA</abbr> which simply keeps track of the hypothesis function with the least in-sample error <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span>. When this is combined with forceful termination after a certain number of iterations, <abbr title="Perceptron Learning Algorithm">PLA</abbr> becomes usable with non-linearly separable data.</p>
<h2 id="linear-regression">Linear Regression</h2>
<p>The word <em>regression</em> simply means real-valued output. For example, in the scenario of credit approval, a classification problem would consist of determining whether or not to grant a credit line to an applicant. However, a regression problem would be determining the dollar amount for a particular credit line.</p>
<p>The linear regression output is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ h(x)  = \sum_{i = 0}^d w_i x_i = \mathbf {w^{\mathrm {T}}x} = \mathbf {w \bullet x} \]</span></p>
<p>For example, the input may look something like this:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \dots, (x_n, y_n) \]</span></p>
<p>Here <span class="math">\(y_n \in \mathbb {R}\)</span> is the credit line for customer <span class="math">\(x_n\)</span>.</p>
<p>The measure of how well <span class="math">\(h\)</span> approximates <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is referred to as the error. With linear regression, the standard error function used is the <em>squared error</em>, defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \text {squared error} = (h(x) - f(x))^2 \]</span></p>
<p>This means that the in-sample error <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \insample(h) = \frac {1} {N} \sum_{n = 1}^N (h(\mathbf {x}_n) - y_n)^2 \]</span></p>
<p>This can be written in terms of <span class="math">\(\vec {w}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\insample(\weight) &amp;= \frac {1} {N} \sum_{n = 1}^N (\weightT \mathbf {x}_n - y_n)^2 \\
                  &amp;= \frac {1} {N} \sum_{n = 1}^N (\weight \bullet \mathbf {x}_n - y_n)^2
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>This can be written in vector form as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
&amp;\insample(w) = \frac {1} {N} \| \mathrm {X} \mathbf {w} - \mathbf {y} \|^2 \\[10pt]
&amp;\text {where}\ \mathrm {X} = \begin{bmatrix}
                              —\ x_1^{\mathrm {T}}\ — \\
                              —\ x_2^{\mathrm {T}}\ — \\
                              \vdots \\
                              —\ x_n^{\mathrm {T}}\ —
                            \end{bmatrix},\ 
              \mathrm {y} = \begin{bmatrix}
                              y_1 \\
                              y_2 \\
                              \vdots \\
                              y_n
                            \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Since the goal is to minimize the in-sample error <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\mathrm {X}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mathrm {y}\)</span> are constant since they were provided as input data, <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> can be minimized by varying <span class="math">\(\vec {w}\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
&amp;\phantom {\nabla} \insample(w) = \frac {1} {N} \| \mathrm {X} \mathbf {w} - \mathbf {y} \|^2 \\
&amp;\nabla \insample(w) = \frac {2} {N} \mathrm {X}^{\mathrm {T}} \left( \mathrm {X} \mathbf {w} - \mathbf {y} \right) = 0 \\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Knowing this, an equation for the weight vector can be found by distributing the <span class="math">\(\mathrm {X}^{\mathrm {T}}\)</span> factor. The <span class="math">\(\mathrm {w}\)</span> factor can then be isolated by multiplying both sides by the inverse of <span class="math">\(\mathrm {X}^{\mathrm {T}} \mathrm {X}\)</span>. The resulting factor <span class="math">\(X^\dagger\)</span> on the right side is known as the <em>pseudo-inverse</em> of <span class="math">\(\mathrm {X}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\mathrm {X}^{\mathrm {T}} \mathrm {Xw} &amp;= \mathrm {X}^{\mathrm {T}} \mathrm {y} \\
\text {if}\ \mathrm {X}^\dagger &amp;= \left( \mathrm {X}^{\mathrm {T}} \mathrm {X} \right)^{-1} \mathrm {X}^{\mathrm {T}} \\
\text {then}\ \mathrm {w} &amp;= \mathrm {X}^\dagger \mathrm {y}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The dimension of <span class="math">\(\mathrm {X}^\mathrm {T}\)</span> is <span class="math">\((d + 1) \times N\)</span>, so the dimension of <span class="math">\(\mathrm X\)</span> is <span class="math">\(N \times (d + 1)\)</span>. This means that even if <span class="math">\(N\)</span> is some large number, their product results in a small square matrix of dimensions <span class="math">\((d + 1) \times (d + 1)\)</span>. This means that the dimensions of <span class="math">\(\mathrm {X}^\dagger\)</span> will be <span class="math">\((d + 1) \times N\)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="linear-regression-for-classification">Classification</h3>
<p>Linear regression learns a real-valued function <span class="math">\(y = f(x) \in \mathbb {R}\)</span>. However, binary-valued functions are also real-valued: <span class="math">\(\pm 1 \in \mathbb {R}\)</span>. Therefore, we can use linear regression to find <span class="math">\(\mathrm w\)</span> where:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \mathrm {w}^{\mathrm {T}} \mathrm {x}_n \approx y_n = \pm 1 \]</span></p>
<p>This way, <span class="math">\(\text {sign} (\mathrm {w}^{\mathrm {T}} \mathrm {x}_n)\)</span> is likely to agree with <span class="math">\(y_n = \pm 1\)</span>. This provides good initial weights for classification.</p>
<h2 id="non-linear-transformations">Non-Linear Transformations</h2>
<p>Not all data is linearly separable. In fact, certain data features aren’t linear. For example, a credit line is affected by “years in residence,” but it doesn’t affect it in a linear way where someone with 10 years in residence will get much more benefit than someone in 5. Instead, the feature can be defined as affecting it in a non-linear manner given the following conditions:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ [\![ x_i &lt; 1 ]\!] \text { and } [\![ x_i &gt; 5 ]\!] \]</span></p>
<p>Linear regression and classification work because they are linear in the weights. For this reason, data can be transformed non-linearly.</p>
<p>For example, if a given data set has positive data points around the center of a region, a transformation could be applied to each point which simply measures the distance from the center of the region to a given point:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ (x_1, x_2) \xrightarrow{\Phi} (x_1^2, x_2^2) \]</span></p>
<p>This newly transformed data set—which is now linearly separable—is used as the new data set.</p>
<p>To recap, non-linear transformations can be used to transform data such that it becomes linearly separable:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>given original data
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(\mathrm {x}_n \in \mathcal X\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>transform the data
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(\mathrm {z}_n = \Phi (\mathrm {x}_n) \in \mathcal Z\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>separate data in the <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(\tilde {g} (\mathrm {z}) = \text {sign} (\tilde {w}^{\mathrm {T}} \mathrm {z})\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>classify in <span class="math">\(\mathcal X\)</span>-space
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(g(\mathrm {x}) = \tilde {g} (\Phi (\mathrm {x})) = \text {sign} (\tilde {w}^{\mathrm {T}} \Phi (\mathrm {x}))\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>A <span class="math">\(\Phi\)</span>-transform transforms input data into the <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-coordinate space:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}

\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<h1 id="error-and-noise">Error and Noise</h1>
<p>Error measures explain what it means for <span class="math">\(h \approx f\)</span>. It is defined as <span class="math">\(E(h, f)\)</span>. It almost always has a pointwise definition <span class="math">\(e(h(\mathbf x), f(\mathbf x))\)</span> which takes as input the value of the same point for both the hypothesis and target functions. An example of this is the squared error and binary error:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\def \xpoint {\mathbf x}
\text {squared error}\colon \quad e(h(\xpoint), f(\xpoint)) = (h(\xpoint) - f(\xpoint))^2
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \text {binary error}\colon \quad e(h(\xpoint), f(\xpoint)) = [\![ h(\xpoint) \not= f(\xpoint)]\!] \]</span></p>
<p>To go from a pointwise error measure to overall, we take the average of pointwise errors.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\insample(h)  &amp;= \frac 1 N \sum_{n = 1}^N e(h(\xpoint_n), f(\xpoint_n)) \\ \\
\outsample(h) &amp;= \mathbb {E}_{\xpoint} \left[ e(h(\xpoint), f(\xpoint)) \right] \\
              &amp;\phantom {=}\ \text {where } \mathbb E \text { is the expected value}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>It can therefore be said that <span class="math">\(g \approx f\)</span> if it is tested with the values from the same distribution that it was trained on and yields an acceptable pointwise error measure.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-the-error-measure">Choosing the Error Measure</h2>
<p>An example in which the choice of error measure is important is fingerprint verification, which returns <span class="math">\(+1\)</span> if it thinks it’s you, and <span class="math">\(-1\)</span> if it thinks it’s an intruder.</p>
<p>There are two types of error:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>false accept</strong>: something that shouldn’t have been accepted was accepted (<em>false positive</em>)</li>
<li><strong>false reject</strong>: something that shouldn’t have been rejected was rejected (<em>false negative</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The question is, how much should each type of error be penalized?</p>

<p>The choice of error measure is application specific. For example, in the scenario that fingerprint recognition is used to determine which customers in a particular supermarket can get discounts, the cost of false rejections or accepts are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>false reject</strong>: costly; customer gets annoyed, possibly switches to competitor</li>
<li><strong>false accept</strong>: minor; give away discount to someone that didn’t qualify for it, but the intruder has left their fingerprint behind (to later train the system to fix that mistake?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Given this particular application domain, we may want to penalize a candidate hypothesis function if it has a high rate of false rejects/negatives, in this case by a factor of <span class="math">\(10\)</span>. False accepts/positives on the other hand are only penalized by a factor of <span class="math">\(1\)</span>.</p>

<p>This reinforces the fact that the error measure is application specific, and thus specified by the user. A question that should be asked to determine the error measure is how much does it cost the application to have a false positive or negative.</p>
<p>However, it isn’t always possible to determine a correct error measure. There are alternatives to this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>plausible measures</strong>: approximate e.g. squared error <span class="math">\(\equiv\)</span> Gaussian noise</li>
<li><strong>friendly measures</strong>: closed-form solution e.g. linear regression, convex optimization</li>
</ul>
<p>In the learning diagram, the error measure goes into the learning algorithm so that it knows what value to minimize among the hypothesis set, and to determine the final hypothesis, to know if the hypothesis candidate approximates the target function.</p>
<h2 id="noise">Noise</h2>
<p>The “target function” is not always a <em>function</em>. In the mathematical sense, a function must return a unique value for any given input. However, going back to the credit-card approval system, it is entirely possible that two given applicants had the exact same feature set (e.g. age, annual salary, years in residence) but ended up having different outputs: one ended up having good credit and the other bad. This is possible because the feature set doesn’t capture every possible factor.</p>
<p>This is mitigated by having a target distribution. Instead of having a function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> that yields an exact answer <span class="math">\(y\)</span> for any given <span class="math">\(\xpoint\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ y = f(\xpoint) \]</span></p>
<p>We will use a target <em>distribution</em>, which still encodes <span class="math">\(y\)</span>’s dependence on <span class="math">\(\xpoint\)</span>, but in a probabilistic manner:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ y \sim P(y \mid \xpoint) \]</span></p>
<p>Now <span class="math">\((\xpoint, y)\)</span> will be generated by the joint distribution:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ P(\xpoint) P(y \mid \xpoint) \]</span></p>
<p>This means that we will get a noisy target, which is equivalent to a deterministic target <span class="math">\(f(\xpoint) = \mathbb {E} (y \mid \xpoint)\)</span> <strong>plus</strong> noise <span class="math">\(y - f(\xpoint)\)</span>.</p>
<p>In fact, a deterministic target is a special case of a noisy target where:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
P(y \mid \xpoint) = \begin{cases}
                      1 &amp; y = f(\xpoint) \\ \\
                      0 &amp; y \not= f(\xpoint)
                    \end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>What this means is that in the learning diagram, we replace the “unknown target function <span class="math">\(f\colon \mathcal {X \to Y}\)</span>” box with “unknown target distribution <span class="math">\(P(y \mid \xpoint)\)</span> target function: <span class="math">\(f\colon \mathcal {X \to Y}\)</span> plus noise”.</p>
<p>It’s important to notice the distinction between <span class="math">\(P(y \mid \xpoint)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(P(\xpoint)\)</span>. <span class="math">\(P(\xpoint)\)</span> is the probability that was introduced to satisfy Hoeffding’s Inequality, derived from the unknown input distribution. <span class="math">\(P(y \mid \xpoint)\)</span> is the probability that was introduced to reflect the fact that real-world target functions are noisy. Both probabilities are derived from <em>unknown</em> probability distributions, they’re unknown because they don’t need to be known.</p>
<p>Both probabilities convey the probabilistic aspects of <span class="math">\(\xpoint\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span>. The target distribution <span class="math">\(P(y \mid \xpoint)\)</span> is what we are trying to learn. The input distribution <span class="math">\(P(\xpoint)\)</span> is simply quantifying the relative example of <span class="math">\(\xpoint\)</span>; we’re not trying to learn it.</p>
<p>The input distribution is the distribution of the feature set in the general population. For example, if the feature set simply consists of salary, then the input distribution says how many people make $70k, $100k, etc.</p>
<p>For this reason, the probabilities can be merged as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ P(\xpoint) P(y \mid \xpoint) \equiv P(\xpoint \cap y) \]</span></p>
<p>This merging mixes two concepts. <span class="math">\(P(\xpoint \cap y)\)</span> is not a target distribution for supervised learning. The target distribution that we are actually trying to learn is <span class="math">\(P(y \mid \xpoint)\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="training-vs-testing">Training vs. Testing</h1>
<p>Learning is feasible because it is likely that:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \outsample(g) \approx \insample(g) \]</span></p>
<p>However, is this <em>really</em> learning?</p>
<p>We’ve defined learning as being <span class="math">\(g \approx f\)</span>, which effectively means that the out-of-sample error for <span class="math">\(g\)</span> should be close to zero:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \outsample(g) \approx 0 \]</span></p>
<p>The above means that “we learned well,” and it’s achieved through:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \outsample(g) \approx \insample(g) \quad \text {and} \quad \insample(g) \approx 0 \]</span></p>
<p>Learning thus reduces to two questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Can we make sure that <span class="math">\(\outsample(g)\)</span> is close enough to <span class="math">\(\insample(g)\)</span>?</li>
<li>Can we make <span class="math">\(\insample(g)\)</span> small enough?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="difference-between-testing-and-training">Difference</h2>
<p>There is a difference between training and testing. It’s analogous to when one takes a practice exam compared to when one takes a final exam.</p>
<p>In the testing scenario, <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> is how well one did in the final exam, and <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> is how well one understands the material in general. In this case, the probability that <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> tracks <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span>—that is, that doing well on the final exam means that they understood the material—increases as the number of questions in the final exam <span class="math">\(N\)</span> increases:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ P(|\insample - \outsample| \gt \epsilon) \leq 2\phantom {M} e^{-2 \epsilon^2 N} \]</span></p>
<p>In the training scenario, <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> is how well one did on the practice problems. The more practice problems <span class="math">\(M\)</span> that were done, the more of a penalty that is incurred because the practice problems are pretty much memorized, and so the topics aren’t learned in a more general manner:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ P(|\insample - \outsample| \gt \epsilon) \leq 2Me^{-2 \epsilon^2 N} \]</span></p>
<h2 id="overlapping-events">Overlapping Events</h2>
<p>The goal is to replace the <span class="math">\(M\)</span> term with something more manageable since otherwise the above “guarantee” isn’t much of a guarantee, since something as simple as the perceptron learning algorithm leads to <span class="math">\(M = \infty\)</span>.</p>
<p>The bad event <span class="math">\(\mathcal B_m\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ |\insample - \outsample| \gt \epsilon \]</span></p>
<p>Bad events can be visualized as a Venn Diagram with varying degrees of overlap. However, the union bound is made regardless of the correlations between the bad events in order to be more general:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ P(\mathcal B_1\ \mathbf {or}\ \mathcal B_2\ \mathbf {or}\ \dots\ \mathbf {or}\ \mathcal B_M) \]</span></p>
<p>As a result, it treated as if the bad events were disjoint, in which case the total area of the sum of all bad events is considered:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \leq \underbrace {P(\mathcal B_1) + P(\mathcal B_2) + \dots + P(\mathcal B_M)}_{\text {no overlaps: M terms}} \]</span></p>
<p>This is a poor bound because in reality the bad events could have significant amounts of overlapping. This is why <span class="math">\(M = \infty\)</span> in many learning algorithms when using this very loose bound.</p>
<p>Given the following perceptron:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px">
<img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/training-versus-testing/e-in.png"> <img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/training-versus-testing/e-out.png">
</div>
<p>When the perceptron (the hypothesis) is changed, there is a huge amount of overlap:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/training-versus-testing/perceptron-overlap.png" class="center"></p>
<p>Only the area in yellow is what has changed between the two perceptrons; everything else overlaps.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
&amp;\Delta \outsample : \text {change in +1 and -1 areas} \\
&amp;\Delta \rlap {\insample} \phantom {\outsample} : \text {change in labels of data points}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Given this observation—that different hypotheses have significant amounts of overlapping with others—we would like to make the statement that one hypothesis exceeds epsilon often when another hypothesis exceeds epsilon.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ |\insample(h_1) - \outsample(h_1)| \approx |\insample(h_2) - \outsample(h_2)| \]</span></p>
<h2 id="dichotomies">Dichotomies</h2>
<p>When counting the number of hypotheses, the entire input space is taken into consideration. In the case of a perceptron, each perceptron differs from another if they differ in at least one input point, and since the input is continuous, there are an infinite number of different perceptrons.</p>
<p>Instead of counting the number of hypotheses in the entire input space, we are going to restrict the count only to the sample: a finite set of input points. Then, simply count the number of the possible <em>dichotomies</em>. A dichotomy is like a mini-hypothesis, it’s a configuration of labels on the sample’s input points.</p>
<p>A hypothesis is a function that maps an input from the entire <em>input space</em> to a result:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ h\colon \mathcal X \to \{-1, +1\} \]</span></p>
<p>The number of hypotheses <span class="math">\(|\mathcal H|\)</span> can be infinite.</p>
<p>A dichotomy is a hypothesis that maps from an input from the <em>sample size</em> to a result:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ h\colon \{\mathbf {x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N}\} \to \{-1, +1\} \]</span></p>
<p>The number of dichotomies <span class="math">\(|\mathcal H(\mathbf {x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N})|\)</span> is at most <span class="math">\(2^N\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(N\)</span> is the sample size. This makes it a candidate for replacing <span class="math">\(M\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="growth-function">Growth Function</h2>
<p>The <em>growth function</em> counts the <em>most</em> dichotomies on any <span class="math">\(N\)</span> points.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\def \growthfunc {m_{\mathcal H}}
\growthfunc(N) = \max_{\mathbf {x_1, \dots, x_N} \in \mathcal X} |\mathcal H(\mathbf {x_1, \dots, x_N})|
\]</span></p>
<p>This translates to choosing any <span class="math">\(N\)</span> points and laying them out in any fashion in the input space. Determining <span class="math">\(m\)</span> is equivalent to looking for such a layout of the <span class="math">\(N\)</span> points that yields the <em>most</em> dichotomies.</p>
<p>The growth function satisfies:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \growthfunc(N) \leq 2^N \]</span></p>
<p>This can be applied to the perceptron. For example, when <span class="math">\(N = 4\)</span>, we can lay out the points so that they are easily separated. However, given a layout, we must then consider all possible configurations of labels on the points, one of which is the following:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/training-versus-testing/breaking-point.png" class="center"></p>
<p>This is where the perceptron breaks down because it <em>cannot</em> separate that configuration, and so <span class="math">\(\growthfunc(4) = 14\)</span> because two configurations—this one and the one in which the left/right points are blue and top/bottom are red—cannot be represented.</p>
<p>For this reason, we have to expect that that for perceptrons, <span class="math">\(m\)</span> can’t be the maximum possible because it would imply that perceptrons are as strong as can possibly be.</p>
<p>We will try to come up with a hypothesis function that can easily determine the value of <span class="math">\(m\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="positive-rays">Positive Rays</h3>
<p>Positive rays are defined on <span class="math">\(\mathbb R\)</span> and define a point <span class="math">\(a\)</span> such that:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
h(x) = \begin{cases}
         +1 &amp; \text {if } x &gt; a \\ \\
         -1 &amp; \text {otherwise}
       \end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/training-versus-testing/positive-rays.png" class="center"></p>
<p><span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span> is the set from the reals to a label <span class="math">\(-1\)</span> or <span class="math">\(+1\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(h\colon \mathbb R \to \{-1, +1\}\)</span>. Put more simply:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ h(x) = \mathrm {sign} (x - a) \]</span></p>
<p>The dichotomy is determined by noticing between which two points in the input set <span class="math">\(a\)</span> falls into, these are the line segments between the input points on the line, of which there are <span class="math">\(N + 1\)</span>, so:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \growthfunc(N) = N + 1 \]</span></p>
<h3 id="positive-intervals">Positive Intervals</h3>
<p>Instead of a ray, we define an interval <span class="math">\([l, r]\)</span> where any point that falls within it is defined as <span class="math">\(+1\)</span> and everything outside it is <span class="math">\(-1\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
h(x) = \begin{cases}
         +1 &amp; \text {if } l \leq x \leq r \\ \\
         -1 &amp; \text {otherwise}
       \end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/training-versus-testing/positive-intervals.png" class="center"></p>
<p>The way to vary the different dichotomies is by choosing two line segments—of which there are again <span class="math">\(N + 1\)</span>—at which to place the interval ends. For this reason, the growth function is:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \growthfunc(N) = {N + 1 \choose 2} \]</span></p>
<p>However, this doesn’t count the configuration in which the interval ends lie on the same line segment, making all points <span class="math">\(-1\)</span>, so we add that:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\growthfunc(N) &amp;= {N + 1 \choose 2} + 1 \\
&amp;= \frac 1 2 N^2 + \frac 1 2 N + 1
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="convex-sets">Convex Sets</h3>
<p>In this case, we take a plane and not a line so that <span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span> is the set of <span class="math">\(h\colon \mathbb R^2 \to \{-1, +1\}\)</span>. In this model, if a point is found within a convex region then it results in <span class="math">\(+1\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(-1\)</span> otherwise.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
h(x) = \begin{cases}
         +1 &amp; \text {if inside region} \\ \\
         -1 &amp; \text {otherwise}
       \end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>A convex region is a region where for any two points picked within a region, the entirety of the line segment connecting them lies within the region. For example, the left image is a convex region, but the one on the right isn’t because the line segment connecting the chosen two points doesn’t fall entirely within the region:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px">
<img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/training-versus-testing/convex-region.png"> <img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/training-versus-testing/non-convex-region.png">
</div>
<p>Convex regions can therefore be used to model dichotomies. The best layout for the points in the input set is to place them on the perimeter of a circle, in which case any configuration of the labels can be satisfied with a convex region as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/training-versus-testing/convex-region-dichotomy.png" class="center"></p>
<p>When a hypothesis set is able to reach every possible dichotomy, it is said that the hypothesis set shattered the points. This means that the hypothesis set is very good at fitting the data, but this is a trade off with generalization.</p>
<h2 id="break-point">Break Point</h2>
<p>What happens when <span class="math">\(\growthfunc(N)\)</span> replaces <span class="math">\(M\)</span>? If the growth function is polynomial then everything will be fine. So we need to prove that <span class="math">\(\growthfunc(N)\)</span> is polynomial.</p>
<p>If no data set of size <span class="math">\(k\)</span> can be shattered by <span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is a <em>break point</em> for <span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span>. By extension, this means that a bigger data set cannot be shattered either. In other words, given a hypothesis set, a break point is the point at which we fail to achieve all possible dichotomies.</p>
<p>We <a href="#growth-function">already saw</a> that for perceptrons, <span class="math">\(k = 4\)</span>.</p>
<p>For positive rays where <span class="math">\(\growthfunc(N) = N + 1\)</span>, the break point is <span class="math">\(k = 2\)</span> because <span class="math">\(2 + 1 = 3\)</span> and this is not the same as <span class="math">\(2^2 = 4\)</span>. This is evidenced by the fact that the below configuration cannot be represented by a positive ray:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/training-versus-testing/positive-ray-break-point.png" class="center"></p>
<p>Similarly, for positive intervals where <span class="math">\(\growthfunc(N) = \frac 1 2 N^2 + \frac 1 2 N + 1\)</span>, the break point is <span class="math">\(k = 3\)</span> because <span class="math">\(\growthfunc(3) = 7 \not= 2^3 = 8\)</span>. The following configuration is an example configuration that cannot be represented by a positive interval:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/training-versus-testing/positive-interval-break-point.png" class="center"></p>
<p>Convex sets don’t have a break point, so <span class="math">\(k = \infty\)</span>. Having no break point means that <span class="math">\(\growthfunc(N) = 2^N\)</span>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if there <em>is</em> a break point, then <span class="math">\(\growthfunc(n)\)</span> is guaranteed to be polynomial (growth) on <span class="math">\(N\)</span>. <strong>This means that it is possible to learn with the given hypothesis set.</strong></p>
<p>For example, consider a puzzle where there are three binary points <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_2\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_3\)</span>. The constraint is that the breaking point is <span class="math">\(k = 2\)</span>, this effectively means that no combination of 2 points can be shattered, which in this context means that no two points can hold every possible combination: 00, 01, 10, and 11. A possible solution to the puzzle is:</p>

<h1 id="theory-of-generalization">Theory of Generalization</h1>
<p>We want to prove that <span class="math">\(\growthfunc(N)\)</span> is indeed polynomial, and also that it is therefore possible to use it to replace <span class="math">\(M\)</span>.</p>
<p>First, to show that <span class="math">\(\growthfunc(N)\)</span> is polynomial, we will show that it is bound by a polynomial:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \growthfunc(N) \leq \dots \leq \dots \leq \text {a polynomial} \]</span></p>
<p>We will use the quantity <span class="math">\(B(N, k)\)</span> which is the maximum number of dichotomies on <span class="math">\(N\)</span> points with break point <span class="math">\(k\)</span>. In other words, the maximum number of rows we can get on <span class="math">\(N\)</span> points such that no <span class="math">\(k\)</span> columns have all possible patterns</p>
<h2 id="conceptualization">Conceptualization</h2>
<p>To understand how <span class="math">\(B(N, k)\)</span> is defined, we should first determine each combination that is possible given a break point <span class="math">\(k\)</span> in a table with a column for every feature <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_i\)</span>. We will then group these rows into two major groups.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(S_1\)</span> is the group of <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> rows that are entirely unique on <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_1\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_N\)</span>. If the last column <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_N\)</span> were removed, there would be no other row in the set with the same <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_1\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_{N - 1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since there are <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> rows in <span class="math">\(S_1\)</span>, we will say that <span class="math">\(B(N, k)\)</span> is defined in terms of it as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ B(N, k) = \alpha\ +\ ? \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\(S_2\)</span> is a group comprised of two subgroups: <span class="math">\(S_2^+\)</span> and <span class="math">\(S_2^-\)</span>. The rows that belong here are those where, if the last row <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_N\)</span> were removed, there would be exactly one other row with the same <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_1\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_{N - 1}\)</span>. If the last column is <span class="math">\(-1\)</span> then it goes into <span class="math">\(S_2^-\)</span> and vice versa. There are <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> rows in <span class="math">\(S_2^+\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> rows in <span class="math">\(S_2^-\)</span> for a total of <span class="math">\(2\beta\)</span> rows in <span class="math">\(S_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can now add the extra term to <span class="math">\(B(N, k)\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ B(N, k) = \alpha + 2\beta \]</span></p>
<h2 id="estimating-alpha-and-beta">Estimating <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span></h2>
<p>We will now look at estimating <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> by relating it to smaller numbers of <span class="math">\(N\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k\)</span> in order to achieve a recursive definition.</p>
<p>If we only focus on the columns <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_1\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_{N - 1}\)</span>, then we can observe that the only unique rows are those in <span class="math">\(S_1\)</span> and those in <em>one</em> of the subgroups of <span class="math">\(S_2\)</span>. This is relevant to <span class="math">\(B(N, k)\)</span> because it only concerns those rows that are <em>different</em> such that a condition occurs, the condition being:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \alpha + \beta \leq B(N - 1, k) \]</span></p>
<p>We can make this relation because we are now considering <span class="math">\(N - 1\)</span> columns instead of all <span class="math">\(N\)</span>, and we are still using a break point of <span class="math">\(k\)</span>. We say “<span class="math">\(\leq\)</span>” and not “<span class="math">\(=\)</span>” as before because before, we made it equal by construction. However, we arrived at the mini-matrix of <span class="math">\(\alpha + \beta\)</span> rows in a manner where we can’t be positive that it maximizes the number of rows. However, we can be sure that it’s at <em>most</em> <span class="math">\(B(N, k)\)</span> because that is the maximum number that is possible.</p>
<h2 id="estimating-beta">Estimating <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span></h2>
<p>We now want to estimate <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> by itself. To do this, we’ll focus only on the <span class="math">\(S_2\)</span> group, comprised of <span class="math">\(S_2^+ \cap S_2^-\)</span> rows. Specifically, we’ll focus on a single mini-matrix of <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> rows, such as <span class="math">\(S_2^+\)</span>, <em>without</em> the last column <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_n\)</span>. We will make the assertion that the break point for this mini-matrix is <span class="math">\(k - 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can say this is true because, if it weren’t, then it would mean that it would indeed be <em>possible</em> to shatter <span class="math">\(k - 1\)</span> points within that mini-matrix. This would mean that we could attain <span class="math">\(2^{k - 1}\)</span> different rows within the mini-matrix; one for each different combination.</p>
<p>However, we must remember that we’re only focusing on one sub-matrix within the overall matrix. Further, we know that by definition there is another sub-matrix <span class="math">\(S_2^-\)</span> with the same amount of rows.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we then were to add back in the <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_n\)</span> column and also consider the rows from <span class="math">\(S_2^-\)</span>, we would have <span class="math">\(2^k\)</span> rows with every possible combination (i.e. shattering <span class="math">\(k\)</span> points), which would <em>contradict</em> the fact that <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is the break point for the larger matrix. Therefore, we can be certain that the break point for the mini-matrix is at most <span class="math">\(k - 1\)</span>. It could be lower, but since we are trying to achieve an upper bound, this is irrelevant.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we can define a relation for the maximum number of dichotomies within this mini-matrix which is composed of <span class="math">\(N - 1\)</span> points and for which we have proved that <span class="math">\(k - 1\)</span> is the break point:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \beta \leq B(N - 1, k - 1) \]</span></p>
<h2 id="bound-relation">Bound Relation</h2>
<p>We want to arrive at an upper bound without having to know <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we combine the two derived relations into a system of inequalities:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\alpha + \beta &amp;\leq B(N - 1, k) \\
\beta &amp;\leq B(N - 1, k - 1)
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Adding them together yields:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \alpha + 2\beta \leq B(N - 1, k) + B(N - 1, k - 1) \]</span></p>
<p>And since we know that:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ B(N, k) = \alpha + 2\beta \]</span></p>
<p>We can say that:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ B(N, k) \leq B(N - 1, k) + B(N - 1, k - 1) \]</span></p>
<h2 id="computing-the-bound">Computing the Bound</h2>
<p>To define this recursive bound, we will have to compute the values of the bound for smaller values of <span class="math">\(N\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="numerical-bound-computation">Numerically</h3>
<p>We can start doing this by filling out a table with the left hand side being <span class="math">\(N\)</span> and the top being <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, where any element in the table specifies the maximum number of dichotomies for that combination <span class="math">\(B(N, k)\)</span>. We begin doing this by filling out the bounds for when <span class="math">\(k = 1\)</span> and when <span class="math">\(N = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>When <span class="math">\(k = 1\)</span>, we will only ever have one dichotomy because we’re using a binary function, since having more than one row would mean that one of the columns is fully exhausted.</p>
<p>When <span class="math">\(N = 1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k \geq 2\)</span>, given that we only have one point, the maximum number of dichotomies we can represent with a binary function is two.</p>
<p>With these bounds, we can then define every other point in the table:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/theory-of-generalization/dichotomy-table.png" class="center"></p>
<p>Remembering that:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ B(N, k) \leq B(N - 1, k) + B(N - 1, k - 1) \]</span></p>
<p>We can take an example such as <span class="math">\(B(3, 3)\)</span>. To get this value, we add <span class="math">\(B(N - 1, k - 1) = B(2, 2) = 3\)</span>, with <span class="math">\(B(N - 1, k) = B(2, 3) = 4\)</span>, resulting in <span class="math">\(B(3, 3) = 7\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="analytical-bound-computation">Analytically</h3>
<p>A more analytic solution for computing the bound is given by the theorem:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\def \upperbound {\sum_{i = 0}^{k - 1} {N \choose i}} 
B(N, k) \leq \upperbound
\]</span></p>
<p>We can easily verify that this is true for the boundary conditions that we derived in the table above.</p>
<p>For every other condition we must consider the induction step. Given the above theorem, it is implied that:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \upperbound = \sum_{i = 0}^{k - 1} {N - 1 \choose i} + \sum_{i = 0}^{k - 2} {N - 1 \choose i} \]</span></p>
<p>So it’s recursively implied that:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
B(N - 1, k) &amp;= \sum_{i = 0}^{k - 1} {N - 1 \choose i} \\
B(N - 1, k - 1) &amp;= \sum_{i = 0}^{k - 2} {N - 1 \choose i}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>We can accomplish this by reducing the right hand side to resemble the left hand side:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}

<p>We can reduce the final expression further by considering the example. You are in a room full of <span class="math">\(N\)</span> people, and want to determine how to choose <span class="math">\(10\)</span> people in the room: <span class="math">\(\smash {N \choose 10}\)</span>. However, this can also be represented as the number of ways we can count <span class="math">\(10\)</span> people <em>excluding</em> you and <em>including</em> you; both cases are disjoint and together cover all combinations.</p>
<p>The number ways to choose <span class="math">\(10\)</span> people <em>excluding</em> you is <span class="math">\(\smash {N - 1 \choose 10}\)</span>. It’s <span class="math">\(N - 1\)</span> because you are being excluded from the total number of people. The number of ways to choose <span class="math">\(10\)</span> people <em>including</em> you is <span class="math">\(\smash {N - 1 \choose 9}\)</span>. It’s <span class="math">\(9\)</span> because you’re already being included, so you just need <span class="math">\(9\)</span> others. Adding these both together should therefore be the same as <span class="math">\(\smash {N \choose 10}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\sum_{i = 0}^{k - 1} {N \choose i} &amp;= 1 + \sum_{i = 1}^{k - 1} \left[ {N - 1 \choose i} + {N - 1 \choose i - 1} \right] \\
&amp;= 1 + \sum_{i = 1}^{k - 1} {N \choose i} \\
&amp;= \upperbound \\ \\
\therefore\ B(N, k) &amp;\leq \upperbound \quad \text {q.e.d}

<p>So the above proves that the growth function <span class="math">\(\growthfunc(N)\)</span> is bounded by a polynomial <span class="math">\(B(N, k)\)</span>. It’s polynomial because for a given <span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span>, the break point <span class="math">\(k\)</span> is fixed.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \growthfunc(N) \leq \underbrace {\upperbound}_{\text {maximum power is } N^{k - 1}} \]</span></p>
<p>To show that this holds, we can use it to determine the growth function <span class="math">\(\growthfunc\)</span> for:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span> is <strong>positive rays</strong> (break point <span class="math">\(k = 2\)</span>):
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(N + 1 \leq N + 1\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span> is <strong>positive intervals</strong> (break point <span class="math">\(k = 3\)</span>):
<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(\frac 1 2 N^2 + \frac 1 2 N + 1 \leq \frac 1 2 N^2 + \frac 1 2 N + 1\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span> is <strong>2D perceptrons</strong> (break point <span class="math">\(k = 4\)</span>):
<ul>

</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vapnik-chervonenkis-inequality">Vapnik-Chervonenkis Inequality</h2>
<p>We would like to replace the <span class="math">\(M\)</span> factor in Hoeffding’s Inequality:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ P(|\insample(g) - \outsample(g)| \gt \epsilon) \leq 2Me^{-2 \epsilon^2 N} \]</span></p>
<p>The following straightforward substitution would not work:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ P(|\insample(g) - \outsample(g)| \gt \epsilon) \leq 2 \growthfunc(N) e^{-2 \epsilon^2 N} \]</span></p>
<p>This is because we need to consider the following questions:</p>
<p>How does <span class="math">\(\growthfunc(N)\)</span> relate to overlaps? If we use the <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> bound, it takes into consideration the various overlaps of the error.</p>
<p>What do we do about <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span>? The problem is that to determine the overlap we need to determine what a “bad point” is: a bad point is one that deviates from <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span>, so we need to know <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span>. Going back to the sheet with the holes analogy where we could only see the color of the points but not the separating line: to determine the error overlap between two separating lines, we would have to remove the covering sheet (the one with the holes).</p>
<p>We could alleviate this by getting rid of <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span>. To do this, we pick <strong>two</strong> samples instead of just one. We already know that <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> track each other because <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> is generated from the same distribution as <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span>. We give the two samples different names: <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\insample&#39;\)</span>. Does <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> track <span class="math">\(\insample&#39;\)</span>? It is obvious that each of them track <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span>, since they were generated from the same distribution, so consequently they <strong>do track each other</strong>, albeit perhaps more loosely.</p>
<p>The advantage of this fact is that, when considering multiple bins, the same situation applies. That is, with multiple bins, the tie between <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> became looser and looser. Likewise, when considering two samples, they do track each other but it becomes looser and looser. The advantage of using two samples is that we are in the realm of dichotomies. We are in the realm of dichotomies because we now only care about what happens in the sample, not the input space, even though the sample is larger now at <span class="math">\(2N\)</span> not <span class="math">\(N\)</span>.</p>
<p>With all of this in mind, the <em>Vapnik-Chervonenkis Inequality</em> is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ P(|\insample(g) - \outsample(g)| \gt \epsilon) \leq 4 \growthfunc(2N) e^{-{\frac 1 8} \epsilon^2 N} \]</span></p>
<p>The growth function is parameterized with <span class="math">\(2N\)</span> because we are now considering two samples. This inequality more or less says that we are making a statement that is probably (<abbr title="Right-Hand Side">RHS</abbr>), approximately (<abbr title="Left-Hand Side">LHS</abbr> epsilon), correct.</p>
<h1 id="vc-dimension">VC Dimension</h1>
<p>The <em><abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> Dimension</em> is a quantity defined for a hypothesis set <span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span> denoted by <span class="math">\(\def \vc {d_{\text {VC}}} \vc(\mathcal H)\)</span> and is defined as the most points that <span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span> can shatter; the largest value of <span class="math">\(N\)</span> for which <span class="math">\(\growthfunc(N) = 2^N\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
N &amp;\leq \vc(\mathcal H)\ \Longrightarrow\ \mathcal H \text { can shatter } N \text { points } \\
N &amp;\gt \vc(\mathcal H)\ \Longrightarrow\ N \text { is a break point for } H
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, the growth function can be defined in terms of a break point <span class="math">\(k\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \growthfunc(N) \leq \upperbound \]</span></p>
<p>It can also be defined in terms of the <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension <span class="math">\(\vc\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \growthfunc(N) \leq \underbrace {\sum_{i = 0}^{\vc} {N \choose i}}_{\text {maximum power is } N^{\vc}} \]</span></p>
<p>With respect to learning, the effect of the <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension is that if the <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension is finite, then the hypothesis will generalize:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \vc(\mathcal H)\ \Longrightarrow\ g \in \mathcal H \text { will generalize } \]</span></p>
<p>The key observation here is that this statement is <strong>independent of</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>the learning algorithm</li>
<li>the input distribution</li>
<li>the target function</li>
</ul>
<p>The only things that factor into this are the training examples, the hypothesis set, and the final hypothesis.</p>
<h2 id="vc-dimension-of-perceptrons">Perceptrons</h2>
<p>We already know that <span class="math">\(\vc = 3\)</span> for <span class="math">\(d = 2\)</span> (2D). However, we would like to generalize this for any dimension. We will argue that <span class="math">\(\vc = d + 1\)</span>. We prove this by showing that <span class="math">\(\vc \leq d + 1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\vc \geq d + 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>To do this we will first construct a set of <span class="math">\(N = d + 1\)</span> points in <span class="math">\(\mathbb R^d\)</span> in such a way that they can be shattered by the perceptron. We begin this by first setting the first element of every row vector to <span class="math">\(1\)</span> since it corresponds to <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span>: the threshold weight which we have already established is always set to <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. The rest of the rows are set so that they form an identity matrix which is easily invertible, which is a property that we will show to mean that every point can be shattered:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\mathrm {X} = \begin{bmatrix}
                —\ x_1^{\mathrm {T}}\ — \\

                \vdots \\
                —\ x_{d + 1}^{\mathrm {T}}\ —
              \end{bmatrix} = 
              \begin{bmatrix}
                1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
                1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\
                1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \cdots &amp; 0 \\

              \end{bmatrix}
\]</span></p>
<p>The key observation is that <span class="math">\(\mathrm X\)</span> is invertible.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\text {For any } \mathrm y = \begin{bmatrix}

                               \vdots \\

                               \pm 1 \\
                             \end{bmatrix}
\]</span></p>
<p>The question is, can we find a vector <span class="math">\(\mathbf w\)</span> satisfying:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \text {sign}(\mathbf {Xw}) = \mathbf y \]</span></p>
<p>We can do this by changing the requirement to be:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \mathbf {Xw} = \mathbf y \]</span></p>
<p>This is valid because we’re using a binary function.</p>
<p>From here it’s a straightforward process to finding the vector <span class="math">\(\mathbf w\)</span> by isolating it, made possible by multiplying both sides by the inverse of the feature matrix <span class="math">\(\mathrm X\)</span>, which we know is invertible because we specifically constructed it to be:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \mathbf w = \mathbf {X^{-1}y} \]</span></p>
<p>Since we were able to come up with <span class="math">\(\mathbf w\)</span>, it means that we were able to shatter <span class="math">\(d + 1\)</span> points. More specifically, it means that we know for a fact that we can shatter <em>at least</em> <span class="math">\(d + 1\)</span> points, but it’s entirely possible that we can shatter more than that:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \vc \geq d + 1 \]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, to prove that <span class="math">\(\vc = d + 1\)</span>, we must now show that <span class="math">\(\vc \leq d + 1\)</span>, since the combination of both of these proofs would prove that <span class="math">\(\vc = d + 1\)</span>. To prove that <span class="math">\(\vc \leq d + 1\)</span>, we must show that we <strong>cannot</strong> shatter <em>any</em> set of <span class="math">\(d + 2\)</span> points.</p>
<p>For any <span class="math">\(d + 2\)</span> points <span class="math">\(\mathbf {x}_1, \dots, \mathbf {x}_{d + 1}, \mathbf {x}_{d + 2}\)</span>, it is obvious that there are more points than dimensions. This is because each feature vector <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_i\)</span> is a <span class="math">\(d + 1\)</span> vector. Since there are more vectors than dimensions, we know that the vectors are linearly dependent; one of the vectors <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_j\)</span> can be represented in terms of the other <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_i\)</span> vectors:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \mathbf x_j = \sum_{i \neq j} a_i \mathbf x_i \]</span></p>
<p>It can be said that not all of the <span class="math">\(a_i\)</span> scalars are zeros, this follows from the fact that <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> is always <span class="math">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now consider the specific dichotomy where the vectors in <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_i\)</span> with a non-zero <span class="math">\(a_i\)</span> get the value <span class="math">\(y_i = \text {sign}(a_i)\)</span>, the vectors with zero-valued <span class="math">\(a_i\)</span> get the value <span class="math">\(\pm 1\)</span>, and the vector <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_j\)</span> gets the value <span class="math">\(y_i = -1\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
y_i &amp;= \text {sign}(\mathbf w^{\mathrm T} \mathbf x_i) =
       \begin{cases}
         \text {sign}(a_i) &amp; \text {if } a_i \text { is non-zero} \\ \\
         \pm 1 &amp; \text {otherwise}
       \end{cases} \\ \\
y_j &amp;= \text {sign}(\mathbf w^{\mathrm T} \mathbf x_j) = -1
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>We are going to argue that no perceptron can implement this dichotomy. Remember that <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_j\)</span> is the linear sum of the rest of the vectors <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_i\)</span>, each scaled by a factor <span class="math">\(a_i\)</span>. We now multiply them by a weight vector, in order to represent a perceptron:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\mathbf x_j = \sum_{i \neq j} a_i \mathbf x_i\ \Longrightarrow\ \mathbf w^{\mathrm T} \mathbf x_j = \sum_{i \neq j} a_i \mathbf w^{\mathrm T} \mathbf x_i
\]</span></p>
<p>An observation to make is that if by definition of the dichotomy, <span class="math">\(\text {sign}(\mathbf w^{\mathrm T} \mathbf x_i) = \text {sign}(a_i)\)</span>, then it means that the signs of both are the same. By extension, this means that their product will always be greater than zero:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\text {if } &amp;y_i = \text {sign}(\mathbf w^{\mathrm T} \mathbf x_i) = \text {sign}(a_i) \\
\text {then } &amp;a_i \mathbf w^{\mathrm T} \mathbf x_i \gt 0
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>This by extension means that the sum of the <span class="math">\(\mathbf x_i\)</span>’s will also greater than zero:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\mathbf w^{\mathrm T} \mathbf x_j = \sum_{i \neq j} a_i \mathbf w^{\mathrm T} \mathbf x_i &gt; 0
\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, since we defined <span class="math">\(y_j = \text {sign}(\mathbf w^{\mathrm T} \mathbf x_j)\)</span> in our dichotomy, the value of <span class="math">\(y_j\)</span> will always be:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ y_j = \text {sign}(\mathbf w^{\mathrm T} \mathbf x_j) = +1 \]</span></p>
<p>However, in our dichotomy we defined <span class="math">\(y_j\)</span> as being equal to <span class="math">\(-1\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ y_j = \text {sign}(\mathbf w^{\mathrm T} \mathbf x_j) = -1 \]</span></p>
<p>Therefore we cannot appropriately represent our dichotomy.</p>
<p>Now we have proved that <span class="math">\(\vc \leq d + 1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\vc \geq d + 1\)</span>. Therefore:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \vc = d = 1 \]</span></p>
<p>What is <span class="math">\(d + 1\)</span> in the perceptron? It is the number of parameters in the perceptron model: <span class="math">\(w_0, w_1, \dots, w_d\)</span>. In essence, this means that when we have a higher number of parameters, we will have a higher <span class="math">\(\vc\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="vc-dimension-interpretation">Interpretation</h2>
<p>The parameters in the weight vector correspond to degrees of freedom that allow us to create a specific hypothesis. The number of parameters correspond to <em>analog</em> degrees of freedom: varying any single parameter—which is itself continuous—yields an entirely new perceptron. The <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension translated these into <em>binary</em> degrees of freedom, since we’re only trying to get a different dichotomy.</p>
<p>This is important because it allows us to ascertain how expressive a model may be; how many different outputs we can actually get.</p>
<p>There is a distinction between parameters and degrees of freedom. This is because parameters may not contribute degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>For example, consider a 1D perceptron. This consists of a weight parameter and a threshold parameter, resulting in two degrees of freedom. This results in <span class="math">\(\vc = d + 1 = 2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now consider the situation where the output of this model is fed as input into another perceptron, which is fed to another perceptron and so on, for a total of four linked perceptrons. This corresponds to <span class="math">\(8\)</span> parameters since each perceptron contains <span class="math">\(2\)</span>. <strong>However</strong>, there are still only <span class="math">\(2\)</span> degrees of freedom because every perceptron after the first simply returns the input; they are redundant.</p>
<p>For this reason, we can think of <span class="math">\(\vc\)</span> as measuring the <em>effective</em> number of parameters.</p>
<h2 id="minimum-sample-size">Minimum Sample Size</h2>
<p>Knowing all this, we would like to find a way to determine the number of training points needed to achieve a certain level of performance. The first realization is that merely having a finite <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension means it’s even possible to learn. We should also remember that the <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> inequality has two quantities that we would like to minimize: <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ P(|\insample(g) - \outsample(g)| &gt; \epsilon) \leq \underbrace {4 \growthfunc(2N) e^{- \frac 1 8 \epsilon^2 N}}_{\delta} \]</span></p>
<p>What we would like to do is say that we want a particular <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>. For example, we would like to be at most 10% away from <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> (<span class="math">\(\epsilon = 10\% = 0.1\)</span>) and we want that statement to be correct at least 95% of the time (<span class="math">\(\delta = 5\% = 0.05\)</span>). How many examples do we need to satisfy these constraints?</p>
<p>The question is, how does <span class="math">\(N\)</span> depend on <span class="math">\(\vc\)</span>? Consider a simplification of the <abbr title="Right-Hand Side">RHS</abbr>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ N^d e^{-N} \]</span></p>
<p>An observation made from plotting the above for increasing values of <span class="math">\(d\)</span> with <span class="math">\(N\)</span> vs the logarithm of the probability shows that <span class="math">\(N\)</span> is proportional to <span class="math">\(\vc\)</span>. A practical observation made by machine learning academics and practitioners is that the actual quantity we are trying to bound follows the same monotonicity as the actual bound, e.g. a bigger <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension yields bigger quantities, if not close to proportional. The higher the <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension, the more examples that are required.</p>
<p>The <em>rule of thumb</em> is that for a large range of reasonable <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>, and for a large range of practical applications, you need at least 10 times the <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ N \geq 10\ \vc \]</span></p>
<h2 id="generalization-bound">Generalization Bound</h2>
<p>We will now simplify the <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> inequality. We’ll begin by denoting the <abbr title="Right-Hand Side">RHS</abbr> as <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ P(|\insample(g) - \outsample(g)| &gt; \epsilon) \leq \underbrace {4 \growthfunc(2N) e^{- \frac 1 8 \epsilon^2 N}}_{\delta} \]</span></p>
<p>We want to get <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> in terms of <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>, to allow us to state the reliability <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> of the statement we would like to achieve, and have the equation output the tolerance <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> that the statement can guarantee with that reliability constraint.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\delta = 4 \growthfunc(2N) e^{- \frac 1 8 \epsilon^2 N}\ \Longrightarrow\ \epsilon = \underbrace {\sqrt {\frac 8 N \ln {\frac {4 \growthfunc(2N)} \delta}}}_{\Omega}
\]</span></p>
<p>This means that the probability that <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> tracks <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> within <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span> is at least <span class="math">\(1 - \delta\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ P(|\outsample - \insample| \leq \Omega(N, \mathcal H, \delta)) \geq 1 - \delta \]</span></p>
<p>The absolute value can be removed because <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> is usually much smaller than <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span>, since <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> is the value we minimize deliberately. The difference between <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> is known as the <em>generalization error</em>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ P(\outsample - \insample \leq \Omega) \geq 1 - \delta \]</span></p>
<p>This can then be rearranged and simplified further into the <em>generalization bound</em>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ P(\outsample \leq \insample + \Omega) \geq 1 - \delta \]</span></p>
<p>The effect of the generalization bound is that it bounds the unknown value <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> by values we do know, namely <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="bias-variance-tradeoff">Bias-Variance Tradeoff</h1>
<p>We have noticed that there is a trade off between approximation and generalization. In other words, we want to minimize <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span>, such that we attain a good approximation of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> out of sample. The more complex the hypothesis set <span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span>, the better chance we have of <em>approximating</em> <span class="math">\(f\)</span>. However, the less complex of a hypothesis set <span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span>, the better the chance of <em>generalizing</em> out of sample.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}

\]</span></p>
<p>We have already learned that <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> analysis is one approach of decomposing <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \outsample \leq \insample + \Omega \]</span></p>
<p>Bias-Variance analysis is another approach to decomposing <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span>, which does so into two components:</p>
<ul>
<li>how well <span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span> can approximate <span class="math">\(f\)</span></li>
<li>how well we can zoom in on a good <span class="math">\(h \in \mathcal H\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Bias-Variance applies to <em>real-valued targets</em> and uses <em>squared error</em>.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \outsample(g^{(\mathcal D)}) = \mathbb E_{\mathrm x} \left[ (g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x) - f(\mathbf x))^2 \right] \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math">\(g^{(\mathcal D)}\)</span> refers to the fact that the hypothesis comes from the dataset <span class="math">\(\mathcal D\)</span>.</p>
<p>Given a budget of <span class="math">\(N\)</span> training examples, we want to generalize the above for any data set of size <span class="math">\(N\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\mathbb E_{\mathcal D} \left[ \outsample(g^{(\mathcal D)}) \right] &amp;= \mathbb E_{\mathcal D} \left[ \mathbb E_{\mathrm x} \left[ (g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x) - f(\mathbf x))^2 \right] \right] \\
&amp;= \mathbb E_{\mathrm x} \left[ \mathbb E_{\mathcal D} \left[ (g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x) - f(\mathbf x))^2 \right] \right]
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>We’re only going to focus on the inner component of the <abbr title="Right-Hand Side">RHS</abbr>. We’re going to consider the concept of an average hypothesis <span class="math">\(\def \avghypo {\bar g} \avghypo\)</span> so that:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \avghypo(\mathbf x) = \mathbb E_{\mathcal D} \left[ g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x) \right] \]</span></p>
<p>The average hypothesis for a particular point <span class="math">\(\mathbf x\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\avghypo(\mathbf x)\)</span>, is equivalent to finding the hypothesis found from many different data sets, then averaging the result of each of those hypothesis on the point <span class="math">\(\mathbf x\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\avghypo(\mathbf x) \approx \frac 1 K \sum_{k = 1}^K g^{(\mathcal D_k)}(\mathbf x)
\]</span></p>
<h2 id="bias-variance-representation">Representation</h2>
<p>We will now decompose the expected error into two components, bias and variance:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\mathbb E_{\mathcal D} \Big[ (g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x) - f(\mathbf x))^2 \Big]
&amp;= \mathbb E_{\mathcal D} \left[ (g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x) - \bar g(\mathbf x) + \bar g(\mathbf x) - f(\mathbf x))^2 \right] \\
&amp;= \mathbb E_{\mathcal D} \Big[ (g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x) - \bar g(\mathbf x))^2 + (\bar g(\mathbf x) - f(\mathbf x))^2 \\
&amp;\phantom {= \mathbb E_{\mathcal D}} + 2\ (g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x) - \bar g(\mathbf x))\ (\bar g(\mathbf x) - f(\mathbf x)) \Big] \\
&amp;= \mathbb E_{\mathcal D} \left[ (g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x) - \bar g(\mathbf x))^2 \right] + (\bar g(\mathbf x) - f(\mathbf x))^2
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The result is an equation that says that the expected error <span class="math">\(\mathbb E_{\mathcal D}\)</span> for a particular data set <span class="math">\(\mathcal D\)</span> given the hypothesis <span class="math">\(g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x)\)</span> resulting from that given data set is measured against the actual target function <span class="math">\(f(\mathbf x)\)</span>, and that error measure <strong>is equivalent</strong> to the <em>variance</em>—the expected error of the hypothesis <span class="math">\(g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x)\)</span> measured against the average hypothesis <span class="math">\(\bar g(\mathbf x)\)</span>, <strong>plus</strong> the <em>bias</em>—the error measure of the average hypothesis <span class="math">\(\bar g(\mathbf x)\)</span> against the target function <span class="math">\(f(\mathbf x)\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\def \bias {\textbf {bias} (\mathbf x)}
\def \var {\textbf {var} (\mathbf x)}
\mathbb E_{\mathcal D} \Big[ (g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x) - f(\mathbf x))^2 \Big] = \underbrace {\mathbb E_{\mathcal D} \left[ (g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x) - \bar g(\mathbf x))^2 \right]}_{\var} + \underbrace {\vphantom {\Big[} (\bar g(\mathbf x) - f(\mathbf x))^2}_{\bias}
\]</span></p>
<p>Both the bias and the variance in the above equation are as measured from a particular point <span class="math">\(\mathbf x\)</span>. The bias essentially represents the bias of the hypothesis set <span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span> away from the target function. The variance is essentially measuring the effect of the finite data set, where each finite data set will vary in its result. Therefore:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\mathbb E_{\mathcal D} \left[ \outsample(g^{(\mathcal D)}) \right] &amp;= \mathbb E_{\mathrm x} \left[ \mathbb E_{\mathcal D} \left[ (g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x) - f(\mathbf x))^2 \right] \right] \\
&amp;= \mathbb E_{\mathrm x} \Big[ \bias + \var \Big] \\
&amp;= \textbf {bias} + \textbf {var}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<h2 id="tradeoff">Tradeoff</h2>
<p>There is a trade off between the bias and the variance:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\textbf {bias} = \mathbb E_{\mathrm x} \Big[ (\bar g(\mathbf x) - f(\mathbf x))^2 \Big] \qquad \textbf {var} = \mathbb E_{\mathrm x} \Big[ \mathbb E_{\mathcal D} \Big[ (g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x) - \bar g(\mathbf x))^2 \Big] \Big]
\]</span></p>
<p>If we go from a small hypothesis to a bigger one, the bias goes down but the variance goes up:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \mathcal H \uparrow\colon \qquad \textbf {bias} \downarrow \qquad \textbf {variance} \uparrow \]</span></p>
<p>We can now formulate the relations between the hypothesis for a given dataset <span class="math">\(\mathcal D\)</span> known as <span class="math">\(g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x)\)</span>, the average hypothesis <span class="math">\(\bar g(\mathbf x)\)</span>, and the target function <span class="math">\(f(\mathbf x)\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x)\ \xrightarrow[\text {variance}]{}\ \bar g(\mathbf x)\ \xrightarrow[\text {bias}]{}\ f(\mathbf x)
\]</span></p>
<p>We will now use an example to prove that this is true. Given a target function that is a sinusoid:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ f\colon [-1, 1] \to \mathbb R \qquad f(x) = \sin(\pi x) \]</span></p>
<p>We are only given two examples <span class="math">\(N = 2\)</span>. There are two hypothesis sets, one is a constant model and the other one is linear, and we would like to see which one is better:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
&amp;\mathcal H_0 \colon \quad h(x) = b \\
&amp;\mathcal H_1 \colon \quad h(x) = ax + b
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>We will now see which one fares better by approximating what we think would be the best hypothesis from each set. In the case of the constant model, we would choose the line at <span class="math">\(y = 0\)</span> to minimize the <abbr title="Mean-Squared Error">MSE</abbr>. The linear model would use a line that also tries to minimize the <abbr title="Mean-Squared Error">MSE</abbr>. The following is the <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> for both:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px">
<img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/bias-variance-tradeoff/constant-model.png"> <img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/bias-variance-tradeoff/linear-model.png">
</div>
<p>It’s clear that from approximation, <span class="math">\(\mathcal H_1\)</span> seems to be better. We will now see which one fares better through machine learning. For example, for these particular two points we get the following result:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px">
<img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/bias-variance-tradeoff/learning-constant-model.png"> <img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/bias-variance-tradeoff/learning-linear-model.png">
</div>
<p>The problem is that these results depend on the two points that we were given, so it complicates the task of comparing the two hypothesis sets. This is why we need bias-variance analysis, it gives us the expected error <em>with respect to</em> the choice of the data set.</p>
<p>If we were derive a hypothesis from any two points, for a large number of different two points, we would come up with something like the left image, where every line represents a derived hypothesis. It therefore stands to reason that the average hypothesis would fall somewhere near <span class="math">\(y = 0\)</span>—the midpoint of the range of possible hypotheses. The error measure of the average hypothesis against the target function is the <em>bias</em>, and the <em>variance</em> is represented by the gray region which corresponds to the standard deviation of the possible hypotheses. It’s apparent that this model has a <em>high bias</em> (<span class="math">\(0.5\)</span>) and a <em>low variance</em> (<span class="math">\(0.25\)</span>):</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px">
<img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/bias-variance-tradeoff/multiple-hypotheses.png"> <img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/bias-variance-tradeoff/average-hypothesis.png">
</div>
<p>The same is slightly more complicated with the second hypothesis <span class="math">\(\mathcal H_1\)</span> because of its linear model, which yields very different hypotheses, that is, <em>high variance</em> (<span class="math">\(1.69\)</span>). There is <em>low bias</em> (<span class="math">\(0.21\)</span>) however, because it has many different hypotheses to average from:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px">
<img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/bias-variance-tradeoff/linear-multiple-hypotheses.png"> <img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/bias-variance-tradeoff/linear-average-hypothesis.png">
</div>
<p>It’s clear that when the two components are summed for both models, the expected error of the first hypothesis set <span class="math">\(\mathcal H_0\)</span> is much lower than <span class="math">\(\mathcal H_1\)</span>’s.</p>
<p>The <strong>conclusion</strong> from this example is that we are matching the <em>model complexity</em> to the <em>data resources</em>, not to the <em>target complexity</em>.</p>
<h2 id="learning-curves">Learning Curves</h2>
<p>A learning curve plots the expected value of <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> as a function of <span class="math">\(N\)</span>. For a data set of size <span class="math">\(N\)</span>, how does the expected <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> and expected <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> vary with <span class="math">\(N\)</span>?</p>
<p>The following images are learning curves for a simple and complex model. The simple model shows that <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> decreases with the <span class="math">\(N\)</span>, but so does <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span>, which can be attributed to exceeding the degrees of freedom available in the hypothesis set. The second model has so many degrees of freedom that it can fit the training set perfectly until the part where the blue curve appears on the left side, however, <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> is very high before that point, which corresponds to not learning anything; just memorizing the examples. Therefore if there are very few examples, then it’s clear that the simple model would fare better. This is why we want to match the model’s complexity to the data resources that we have.</p>

<p>The following is a comparison of the learning curves for a given model using <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> analysis and bias-variance analysis.

In the Bias-Variance curve, the black bar is the approximation. Everything below the approximation is the bias, so everything else under the <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> curve must be the variance. Both curves are talking about approximations.

<h2 id="analysis-of-linear-regression">Analysis of Linear Regression</h2>
<p>Given a data set <span class="math">\(\mathcal D = \{ (\mathbf x_1, y_1), \dots, (\mathbf x_n, y_n)\}\)</span> and a noisy target function:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[y = \mathbf w^{* \mathrm T} \mathbf x + \text {noise}\]</span></p>
<p>The linear regression solution is:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \mathbf w = \left( \mathrm {X}^{\mathrm {T}} \mathrm {X} \right)^{-1} \mathrm {X}^{\mathrm {T}} \mathbf y \]</span></p>
<p>The in-sample error vector would be:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \mathrm X \mathbf w - \mathbf y \]</span></p>
<p>The ‘out-of-sample’ error vector would be calculated by generating a new set of points from the same inputs but with different noise and would therefore be:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \mathrm X \mathbf w - \mathbf y&#39; \]</span></p>
<p>This yields the following analysis learning curve. Up until <span class="math">\(d + 1\)</span> data points, the data was being fit perfectly. The best approximation error, the variance of the noise, is denoted by <span class="math">\(\sigma^2\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/bias-variance-tradeoff/linear-regression-learning-curve.png" class="center"></p>

<h1 id="linear-model-ii">Linear Model II</h1>
<h2 id="non-linear-transformations-ii">Non-Linear Transformations II</h2>
<p>To recap, a transformation <span class="math">\(\Phi\)</span> transforms the input vector <span class="math">\(\mathbf x\)</span> to the feature space, resulting in a feature vector <span class="math">\(\mathbf z\)</span>, where every element <span class="math">\(z_i\)</span> is the result of performing a non-linear transformation <span class="math">\(\phi_i\)</span> on the <em>entire</em> input vector. Therefore, <span class="math">\(\mathbf z\)</span> can be of different size, often longer, than the input vector <span class="math">\(\mathbf x\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\mathrm {x} = (x_0, x_1, \dots, x_d)\ \xrightarrow{\Phi}\ &amp;\mathrm {z} = (z_0, z_1, \dots \dots, z_{\tilde d}) \\
&amp;\text {each } z_i = \phi_i(\mathbf x) \\
&amp;\mathbf z = \Phi(\mathbf x) \\
\text {e.g. } &amp;\mathbf z = (1, x_1, x_2, x_1 x_2, x_1^2, x_2^2)
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>It’s important to remember that the final hypothesis <span class="math">\(g(\mathbf x)\)</span> will always be in the <span class="math">\(\mathcal X\)</span>-space; the <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space is transparent to the user.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ g(\mathbf x) = \text {sign}(\tilde w^{\mathrm T} \Phi(\mathbf x)) \qquad \text {or} \qquad \tilde w^{\mathrm T} \Phi(\mathbf x) \]</span></p>
<p>What is the price paid in using a non-linear transformation? Well it has been established that the <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension of a <span class="math">\(d + 1\)</span> sized input vector is <span class="math">\(d + 1\)</span>, therefore the feature vector <span class="math">\(\mathbf z\)</span>, whose size is <span class="math">\(\tilde d + 1\)</span>, will have a <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension of at most <span class="math">\(\tilde d + 1\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(\tilde d\)</span> is generally larger than <span class="math">\(d\)</span>. It’s “at most” because the <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension is always measured in the <span class="math">\(\mathcal X\)</span>-space, and this is the <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space. While this means that we will be able to better fit the data, we won’t have much of a chance of generalization.</p>
<p>For example considering the following <strong>case 1</strong> where there are two outliers in the data set. If we want to really fit the data, we could use a 4th-order surface in order to completely classify the data in the set. However, this increase in complexity would mean that it’d be very difficult to generalize. Sometimes it’s best to accept that there will be an <span class="math">\(\insample &gt; 0\)</span>.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px">
<img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/linear-model-ii/non-linear-case-1.png"> <img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/linear-model-ii/non-linear-case-1-transformed.png">
</div>
<p>Now consider <strong>case 2</strong>, where we don’t stand a chance using a linear model to fit the data, which clearly falls inside a circular region:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/linear-model-ii/non-linear-case-2.png" class="center"></p>
<p>In this case, we can use a non-linear transformation to map the data to a general 2nd-order surface as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \mathbf x = (1, x_1, x_2)\ \xrightarrow{\Phi}\ \mathbf z = (1, x_1, x_2, x_1 x_2, x_1^2, x_2^2) \]</span></p>
<p>Note that with <span class="math">\(\mathbf x\)</span> we were only using three weights, however in <span class="math">\(\mathbf z\)</span> we are using six weights. This effectively translates to now requiring twice as many examples to achieve the same level of performance. So a natural conclusion is to try to find a way to avoid paying this increase in cost.</p>
<p>First let’s consider the following alternative model, since it seems we only need <span class="math">\(x_1^2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_2^2\)</span> to represent the circle. Now we only have three weights again, the same as with the linear model represented by <span class="math">\(\mathbf x\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \mathbf z = (1, x_1^2, x_2^2) \]</span></p>
<p>We reduce the cost further by adopting the following model, which does away with representing the independence of <span class="math">\(x_1^2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_2^2\)</span>, as they simply represent the radius:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \mathbf z = (1, x_1^2 + x_2^2) \]</span></p>
<p>Now consider the extreme case, where we completely reduce to a single parameter, completely doing away with the threshold weight:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \mathbf z = (x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 0.6) \]</span></p>
<p>The problem with these reductions is that the guarantee of the <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> inequality is forfeited if we look at the data. We can consider the concept of us simplifying the model for the machine as performing a hierarchical learning process, where we the human do some learning, and then pass the result for the machine to finish the learning process. From this perspective, it’s apparent that the <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension resulting from this process is that of the entire hypothesis space that we as the human considered during the simplification process.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that <strong>looking at the data <em>before</em> choosing the model can be hazardous to your</strong> <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span>. The act of looking at the data before choosing the model is one of the many mistakes that fall under <em>data snooping</em>.</p>
<h2 id="logistic-regression">Logistic Regression</h2>
<p>We’re already familiar with two linear models. The first is <em>linear classification</em> which classifies data points based on what side of a hyperplane they’re on. The second is <em>linear regression</em>, which makes it straightforward to predict a regression, and is computed by skipping the last step of linear classification, the part where it determines the sign of the result.</p>
<p>A third model called <em>logistic regression</em> can predict the probability of an event occurring, and is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ h(\mathbf x) = \theta(s) \]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math">\(s\)</span> is simply the dot product of the weight and feature vectors as is done in the other two linear models, and <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> is a non-linear function that is often called a <em>sigmoid</em>, and looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/linear-model-ii/sigmoid.png" class="center"></p>
<p>In our particular case, the formula we’re going to use is:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \theta(s) = \frac {e^s} {1 + e^s} \]</span></p>
<p>This kind of function is also called a “soft threshold,” since it’s a gradual increase rather than a hard increase as in linear classification. It is in this way that this kind of function expresses uncertainty.</p>
<p>Given this functions’ bounds <span class="math">\((0, 1)\)</span> and the fact that it’s a “soft threshold,” it’s clear that it can be interpreted as a probability. For example, when predicting heart attacks, we want to predict whether there’s a small or big risk in having a heart attack anytime soon. If we used a binary function as in linear classification, it would be too hard of a threshold and thus wouldn’t really convey as much meaningful information, since it isn’t clear exactly which things definitely cause heart attacks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, with a logistic regression model, we could predict the probability of having a heart attack in the next 12 months. In this context, the dot product between the weight and feature vector can be considered a “risk score,” which can give one a general idea of the result but which must still be passed through the logistic function in order to determine the probability.</p>
<p>A key point is that this probability is considered as a genuine probability. That is, not only does the logistic function have bounds of <span class="math">\((0, 1)\)</span>, but that the examples also have a probabilistic interpretation. For example, the input data consists of feature vectors and binary results. It’s clear that there is some sort of probability embedded in yielding the binary results, but it is unknown to us. Therefore it can be said that the binary result is generated by a noisy target:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
P(y \mid \mathbf x) = \begin{cases}
                        f(\mathbf x) &amp; \text {for } y = +1; \\ \\
                        1 - f(\mathbf x) &amp; \text {for } y = -1.
                      \end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>So the target <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ f\colon \mathbb R^d \to [0, 1] \text { is the probability} \]</span></p>
<p>And we want to learn <span class="math">\(g\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ g(\mathbf x) = \theta(\mathbf w^{\mathrm T} \mathbf x) \approx f(\mathbf x) \]</span></p>
<h3 id="logistic-regression-error-measure">Error Measure</h3>
<p>We have established that for each data point <span class="math">\((\mathbf x, y)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(y\)</span> is generated by the probability <span class="math">\(f(\mathbf x)\)</span>. The plausible error measure is based on <em>likelihood</em>, that is, we are going to grade different hypotheses according to the likelihood that they are actually the target that generated the data. In other words, we are going to assume that a given hypothesis is indeed the target function, and then we will determine how likely it is to get a given result from its corresponding feature vector. Expressed mathematically:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
P(y \mid \mathbf x) = \begin{cases}
                        h(\mathbf x) &amp; \text {for } y = +1 \\ \\
                        1 - h(\mathbf x) &amp; \text {for } y = -1
                      \end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>Now substitute <span class="math">\(h(\mathbf x)\)</span> with <span class="math">\(\theta(\weightT \feature)\)</span>, while noting that <span class="math">\(\theta(-s) = 1 - \theta(s)\)</span>, since:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\theta(-s) &amp;= \frac {e^{-s}} {1 + e^{-s}} \\
&amp;= \frac 1 {e^s} * \frac 1 {1 + e^{-s}} \\
&amp;= \frac 1 {e^s + 1} \\
1 - \theta(s) &amp;= 1 - \frac {e^s} {1 + e^s} \\
&amp;= \frac {1 + {e^s}} {1 + {e^s}} - \frac {e^s} {1 + e^s} \\
&amp;= \frac 1 {1 + e^s}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>So now we can simplify the probability to:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ P(y \mid \feature) = \theta(y \weightT \feature) \]</span></p>
<p>Now we can determine the likelihood of the entire data set <span class="math">\(\mathcal D = (\feature_1, y_1), \dots, (\feature_N, y_N)\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\prod_{n = 1}^N P(y_n \mid \feature_n) =
\prod_{n = 1}^N \theta(y_n \weightT \feature_n)
\]</span></p>
<p>It’s noteworthy to observe that the same weight vector is being used for each of those products, so that if it’s varied to better fit one particular data point, it might no longer fit another. Therefore, whatever maximizes this product would represent the likelihood that the weight vector is representing the underlying probability distribution.</p>
<p>So now we want to see how to maximize the likelihood with respect to <span class="math">\(\weight\)</span>. This corresponds to minimizing the error:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}

<h3 id="logistic-regression-learning-algorithm">Learning Algorithm</h3>
<p>Now that we have the learning model and error measure we can define the learning algorithm. Compared to the closed-form solution from the other two models, we will have to use an iterative solution called <em>gradient descent</em>, which is a general method for non-linear optimization.</p>
<p>Gradient descent starts at a point on the error function and iteratively takes steps along the steepest slope towards the minimum. So we’ll have a direction unit vector <span class="math">\(\hat v\)</span> pointed in the direction of the steepest slope and a fixed step size <span class="math">\(\eta\)</span> which we will define as being small since we want to approximate the surface using the first order expansion of the Taylor series—the linear approximation—which works best when the distance between the two points is small. With this in mind, the new position after a step can be expressed as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \weight(1) = \weight(0) + \eta \hat v \]</span></p>
<p>To derive the direction unit vector <span class="math">\(\hat v\)</span>, we first observe that the change in the value of the error is simply the difference between the error at the new point and the error at the original point:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\Delta \insample = \insample(\mathbf w(0) + \eta \hat v) - \insample(\mathbf w(0))
\]</span></p>
<p>Remembering that the Taylor series is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac {f^{(n)}(a)} {n!} (x - a)^n \]</span></p>
<p>Then the first-order approximation is defined as <span class="math">\(n = 1\)</span> so that the series is:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ f(x) = f(a) + \frac {f&#39;(a)} {1!} (x - a) + R_2 \]</span></p>
<p>If we drop the remainder term <span class="math">\(R_2\)</span>, then we are left with the linear approximation:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ f(x) \approx f(a) + f&#39;(a)(x - a) \]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, for <span class="math">\(f(x + a)\)</span> it is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
f(a + x) &amp;\approx f(a) + f&#39;(a)x \\
f&#39;(a)x   &amp;\approx f(a + x) - f(a)
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>This representation of the linear approximation is similar to our definition of the change in the value of the error between the two positions:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\Delta \insample = \insample(\mathbf w(0) + \eta \hat v) - \insample(\mathbf w(0))
\]</span></p>
<p>However, we don’t want to use the linear approximation just yet. There’s another concept known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient">gradient</a> which basically defines a vector field so that at any given point in the space, a vector is available at that point which points in the direction of the “steepest ascent.” The gradient is simply defined as the vector of all of the possible partial derivatives. For example, given a function:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ f(x, y, z) = 2x + 3y^2 - \sin(z) \]</span></p>
<p>The gradient is denoted by the <span class="math">\(\nabla\)</span> symbol and is defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\nabla f &amp;= \frac {\partial f} {\partial x} \hat i + \frac {\partial f} {\partial y} \hat j + \frac {\partial f} {\partial z} \hat k \\
&amp;= 2 \hat i + 6y \hat j - \cos(z) \hat k \\
&amp;= \begin{bmatrix} 2 &amp; 6y &amp; -\cos(z) \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>It’s obvious how the gradient can be useful here. It provides us with a way to determine—at any point on the surface—in what direction to move to go deeper towards the minimum. This is possible by finding the gradient vector—which points in the direction of the “steepest ascent”—and negate it so that it then points in the direction of the “steepest descent”. This is clearly useful, and fortunately there is a similar linear approximation to a vector-taking function <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient#Linear_approximation_to_a_function">for a gradient</a>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ f(\mathbf x) \approx f(\mathbf x_0) + \nabla f(\mathbf x_0) (\mathbf x - \mathbf x_0) \]</span></p>
<p>This means that for <span class="math">\(f(\mathbf x + \mathbf x_0)\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
f(\mathbf x + \mathbf x_0) &amp;\approx f(\mathbf x_0) + \nabla f(\mathbf x_0) \cdot (\mathbf x - \mathbf x_0) \\
\nabla f(\mathbf x_0) \cdot \mathbf x &amp;\approx f(\mathbf x + \mathbf x_0) - f(\mathbf x_0) \\
\nabla f(\mathbf x_0)^{\mathrm T} \mathbf x &amp;\approx f(\mathbf x + \mathbf x_0) - f(\mathbf x_0) \\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>So we can replace the <abbr title="Right-Hand Side">RHS</abbr> with the dot product of the gradient and the unit vector <span class="math">\(\hat v\)</span> <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\Delta \insample &amp;= \insample(\mathbf w(0) + \eta \hat v) - \insample(\mathbf w(0)) \\
&amp;= \eta \nabla \insample(\mathbf w(0))^{\mathrm T} \hat v
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Since we know that <span class="math">\(\hat v\)</span> is a unit vector, we know that regardless of the value of <span class="math">\(\hat v\)</span>, the inner product between <span class="math">\(\nabla \insample(\mathbf w(0))\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\hat v\)</span> cannot exceed the norm <span class="math">\(\lVert \nabla \insample(\mathbf w(0)) \rVert\)</span>, be it in the positive or negative direction. Therefore we can guarantee that <span class="math">\(\Delta \insample\)</span> must be greater than or equal to the negative norm:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \Delta \insample \geq -\eta \lVert \nabla \insample(\mathbf w(0)) \rVert \]</span></p>
<p>We would therefore like to choose <span class="math">\(\hat v\)</span> that is closest to this lower bound, since we want to minimize the error, and a negative change in error corresponds to a big decrease in error, and therefore descending rapidly. Since <span class="math">\(\hat v\)</span> is by definition a unit vector, we can simply take the gradient itself and divide it by its norm to normalize it, then negate it to flip from ascent to descent.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \hat v = - \eta \frac {\nabla \insample(\mathbf w(0))} {\lVert \nabla \insample(\mathbf w(0)) \rVert} \]</span></p>
<p>The above implies a fixed step. We could instead adopt a step distance based on the slope of the current position, easily accomplished by scaling the direction vector <span class="math">\(\hat v\)</span> by the norm of the gradient at the current position. This allows the algorithm to take bigger steps in steeper locations, and take smaller steps once it begins to near the minimum. In this case, <span class="math">\(\eta\)</span> now refers to the “learning rate”:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\Delta \mathbf w = - \eta \frac {\nabla \insample(\mathbf w(0))} {\lVert \nabla \insample(\mathbf w(0)) \rVert} \lVert \nabla \insample(\mathbf w(0)) \rVert = - \eta \nabla \insample(\mathbf w(0))
\]</span></p>
<p>Now that we have all of the pieces we can construct the learning algorithm:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>initialize the weights at <span class="math">\(t = 0\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\weight(0)\)</span></li>
<li>for <span class="math">\(t = 0, 1, 2, \dots\)</span> do
<ol type="1">
<li><p>compute the gradient <span class="math">\[ \nabla \insample = - \frac 1 N \sum_{n = 1}^N \frac {y_n \feature_n} {1 + e^{y_n \weightT(t) \feature_n}} \]</span></p></li>
<li>update the weights: <span class="math">\(\weight(t + 1) = \weight(t) - \eta \nabla \insample\)</span></li>
<li>repeat until it is time to stop</li>
</ol></li>
<li>return the final weights <span class="math">\(\weight\)</span></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="stochastic-gradient-descent">Stochastic Gradient Descent</h2>
<p>Gradient descent minimizes <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> by iterative steps <span class="math">\(\Delta \weight\)</span> along <span class="math">\(- \nabla \insample\)</span>, and each one of those steps occurs only after a full <em>epoch</em>, where an epoch marks the event of having examined all of the examples. Instead of being restricted to taking steps only after having examined all of the examples, we would like to try to adapt it so that it can perform a step after having considered a single random example. This modified gradient descent is known as <em>stochastic gradient descent</em>, whereas comparatively the “original” gradient descent will be referred to henceforth as <em>batch gradient descent</em> because it performed a step <span class="math">\(\Delta \weight\)</span> only after having examined all of the examples.</p>
<p>This is accomplished by performing epochs until a tolerance is met, where each epoch consists of examining every single example in a random order, and for every example considered, recomputing the gradient based on that example alone and descending along its negative direction. Compare this to batch gradient descent, which had to compute the gradient based on all of the points and summing up the result.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>until desired tolerance is met
<ol type="1">
<li>(epoch) for every example considered in a random order
<ol type="1">
<li>perform a descent along the negative of the gradient which was computed for that example</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Stochastic gradient descent is a randomized version of gradient descent, where we pick <strong>one</strong> example <span class="math">\((\feature_n, y_n)\)</span> at a time and apply gradient descent based on <span class="math">\(\crossentropy(h(\feature_n), y_n)\)</span>, similar to <abbr title="Perceptron Learning Algorithm">PLA</abbr>. It’s expected that this is similar to performing the descent by considering every single point:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\mathbb E_n \left[ - \nabla \crossentropy(h(\feature_n), y_n) \right] &amp;=
\frac 1 N \sum_{n = 1}^N - \nabla \crossentropy(h(\feature_n), y_n) \\
&amp;= - \nabla \insample
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>There are a variety of benefits of <abbr title="Stochastic Gradient Descent">SGD</abbr>. One is that it is a <strong>cheaper computation</strong>, because we can make a move, or descent, after having considered one point instead of every single point. Another advantage is <strong>randomization</strong> which can help in escaping very shallow local minima or certain flat regions that precede the actual minimum. Finally, <abbr title="Stochastic Gradient Descent">SGD</abbr> is a <strong>very simple</strong> optimization, so it is widely used and a variety of “rules of thumb” have been formulated. For example, one rule of thumb is to start with a learning rate of <span class="math">\(\eta = 0.1\)</span> and scale it from there.</p>
<p>For example, think back to the movie ratings model which can learn to suggest movies to users based on their tastes. The user <span class="math">\(i\)</span>’s vector <span class="math">\(\mathbf u\)</span> consists of tastes <span class="math">\(u_1, u_2, \dots, u_k\)</span> in different movie qualities, the movie <span class="math">\(j\)</span>’s vector <span class="math">\(\mathbf v\)</span> corresponds to how well a movie represents each of those qualities <span class="math">\(v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k\)</span> in the feature vector, and the result <span class="math">\(r_{ij}\)</span> is the movie rating.</p>
<p>We can take the dot product between the user and movie vector as a measure of how well both agree with each other, in fact, this will correspond to the rating. Therefore, the error measure can be represented as the difference between the actual rating and the computed rating:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \mathbf e_{ij} = \left( r_{ij} - \sum_{k = 1}^K u_{ik} v_{jk} \right)^2 \]</span></p>
<h2 id="neural-network-model">Model</h2>
<p>The perceptron model has a break point of 4 because it couldn’t properly model situations such as the following:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/neural-networks/impossible-perceptron.png" class="center"></p>
<p>Although the above can’t be modeled with one perceptron, perhaps the combination of more than one perceptron can. For example, we could divide the space twice, independently, with two different perceptrons and then somehow combine their results to effectively model the above scenario:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px">
<img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/neural-networks/impossible-perceptron-left.png"> <img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/neural-networks/impossible-perceptron-right.png">
</div>
<p>The results of these two independent perceptrons can be combined to model the impossible scenario. Specifically, one way this can be accomplished is by modeling logical AND and OR operations to combine results of separate perceptrons.</p>
<p>Logical OR can be modeled as a perceptron where the threshold weight <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> is set to <span class="math">\(1.5\)</span>. This way it’ll only return <span class="math">\(-1\)</span> if both of the other features are <span class="math">\(-1\)</span>, as is expected of logical OR:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/neural-networks/or-gate.png" class="center"></p>
<p>Logical AND can be modeled as a perceptron where the threshold weight <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> is set to <span class="math">\(-1.5\)</span>. This way, both of the other features have to be <span class="math">\(+1\)</span> in order to overcome the threshold weight and thus return <span class="math">\(+1\)</span>, just as with logical AND:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/neural-networks/and-gate.png" class="center"></p>
<p>With these models, we can model the original complicated scenario. We can take the AND result of one of the perceptrons such as <span class="math">\(h_1\)</span> and the negation of the other perceptron, <span class="math">\(h_2\)</span>. This essentially means that the bottom quadrant in the target model would be <span class="math">\(h_1\)</span>’s <code>+</code> AND the negation of <span class="math">\(h_2\)</span>’s <code>-</code> which results in <code>+</code> as in the target model. The left quadrant can similarly be modeled by taking <span class="math">\(h_1\)</span>’s <code>-</code> AND the negation of <span class="math">\(h_2\)</span>’s <code>-</code> which results in <code>-</code> as in the target model. We take this and OR it with the alternate scenario, where <span class="math">\(h_1\)</span>’s values are negated, to fully complete the model.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/neural-networks/simple-layers.png" class="center"></p>
<p>The full, multi-layer perceptron can now be constructed, with the additional layer at the beginning which yields the separate, independent perceptrons <span class="math">\(h_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(h_2\)</span>. Note that there are three layers, and it is strictly “feedforward,” that is, we don’t feed outputs to previous layers nor do we skip layers:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/neural-networks/multilayer-perceptron.png" class="center"></p>
<p>This new model seems very powerful, with a seemingly infinite degree of freedom able to model a variety of situations. For example, we can model a circle only using perceptrons instead of using a non-linear transformation as we did before. The more perceptrons we use, the better the approximation:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/neural-networks/circular-perceptron-model.png" class="center"></p>
<p>There are two costs that this seemingly powerful model can incur. The first is <em>generalization</em> because we have so many perceptrons, yielding a higher <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension and with it higher degrees of freedom. This is a problem, but at least being aware of it means that we can overcome it by simply using an adequate number of examples. The other, perhaps more important cost, is that of <em>optimization</em>. When the data is not separable, it becomes a combinatorial optimization problem that is very difficult to solve.</p>
<p>The problem of optimization can be solved by using soft thresholds instead of the hard thresholds found in perceptrons. This can be facilitated with gradient descent, which features soft thresholds. Once the solution is found with soft thresholds and as a result so are the weights, we can switch to hard thresholds to perform classifications.</p>
<p>A neural network has various inputs and layers. Each layer has a non-linearity <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span>, which is a generic non-linearity—not specifically the logistic function in logistic regression. To be precise, the non-linearity <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> is similar to the logistic function except that it ranges from <span class="math">\(-1\)</span> to <span class="math">\(+1\)</span>, to better approximate the hard threshold that goes from <span class="math">\(-1\)</span> to <span class="math">\(+1\)</span>. Each of the non-linearities <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> can be different. A famous approach to take is to make all of the <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span>’s be non-linear and then make the final <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> actually be linear. The intermediate layers are referred to as <em>hidden layers</em>. The final layer is referred to as the <em>output layer</em>:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/neural-networks/neural-network.png" class="center"></p>
<p>The non-linearity <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> in the neural network is the hyperbolic <span class="math">\(\tan\)</span>, the <span class="math">\(\tanh\)</span> function which takes on values ranging from <span class="math">\((-1, +1)\)</span>. If the signal (sum of the weights) is small then the <span class="math">\(\tanh\)</span> function acts linear, and otherwise if it is very large then it asks as a hard threshold:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \theta(s) = \tanh(s) = \frac {e^s - e^{-s}} {e^s + e^{-s}} \]</span></p>
<p><img id="tanh" src="/images/notes/machine-learning/neural-networks/tanh.png" class="center"></p>
<p>The parameters of the neural network are weights <span class="math">\(w\)</span> indexed by three indices consisting of the layers, inputs, and outputs, and each of these indices take on the following ranges:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
w^{(l)}_{ij} = \begin{cases}
                 1 \leq l \leq L &amp; \text {layers} \\
                 0 \leq i \leq d^{(l - 1)} &amp; \text {inputs} \\
                 l \leq j \leq d^{(l)} &amp; \text {ouputs}
               \end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>The neural network can therefore be represented by a recursive definition:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\def \neuronweight {w_{ij}^{(l)}}
x^{(l)}_j = \theta \left(s^{(l)}_j\right) =
\theta \left( \sum_{i = 0}^{d^{(l - 1)}} \neuronweight x_i^{(l - 1)} \right)
\]</span></p>
<p>The neural network is then constructed by applying the feature vector <span class="math">\(\feature\)</span> to the first layer in the neural network <span class="math">\(x^{(0)}_1, \dots, x^{(0)}_{d^{(0)}}\)</span> such that it eventually ends up in one scalar valued output from the last layer <span class="math">\(\smash {x^{(L)}_1}\)</span>, which is the value that we will say that <span class="math">\(h(\feature)\)</span> produces.</p>
<h2 id="neural-network-backpropagation">Backpropagation</h2>
<p>We will now apply stochastic gradient descent to our neural network. With <abbr title="Stochastic Gradient Descent">SGD</abbr>, whenever an example passes through the neural network, we will adjust all of the weights in the network in the direction of the negative of the gradient of that single example.</p>
<p>Therefore it can be said that all of the weights <span class="math">\(\weight = \{ w^{(l)}_{ij} \}\)</span> determine <span class="math">\(h(\feature)\)</span>. We then get the error on the example <span class="math">\((\feature_n, y_n)\)</span> which is defined as <span class="math">\(\crossentropy(h(\feature_n), y_n) = \crossentropy(\weight)\)</span>. Therefore, to implement <abbr title="Stochastic Gradient Descent">SGD</abbr> we need to obtain the gradient <span class="math">\(\nabla \crossentropy(\weight)\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \nabla \crossentropy(\weight)\colon \frac {\partial \crossentropy(\weight)} {\partial w^{(l)}_{ij}} \quad \text {for all } i, j, l \]</span></p>
<p>There is a trick for efficient computation of the gradient by using the chain rule to separate the partial derivative into two separate partial derivatives:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \frac {\partial \crossentropy(\weight)} {\partial w^{(l)}_{ij}} = \frac {\partial \crossentropy(\weight)} {\partial s^{(l)}_j} \times \frac {\partial s^{(l)}_j} {\partial w^{(l)}_{ij}} \]</span></p>
<p>This is easily observable when we look at a diagram of a neural network layer:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/neural-networks/final-delta.png" class="center"></p>
<p>We already know the second component’s result:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
s^{(l)}_j = w^{(l)}_{ij} x^{(l - 1)}, \quad \text {so}\ 
\frac {\partial s^{(l)}_j} {\partial w^{(l)}_{ij}} = x^{(l - 1)}
\]</span></p>
<p>Now we only need to determine the value of the first component, which we will refer to as <span class="math">\(\smash {\delta^{(l)}_j}\)</span>. This component would be easiest to compute if we knew the error output itself, for this reason, we will first compute it at the last layer and then propagate it backwards throughout the rest of the neural network. So what we want is <span class="math">\(\smash {\delta^{(L)}_1}\)</span>, but first we’ll have to define <span class="math">\(\crossentropy(\weight)\)</span> for the final layer:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\crossentropy(\weight) &amp;= \crossentropy(h(\feature_n), y_n) \\
&amp;= \crossentropy(x^{(L)}_1, y_n) \\
&amp;= (x^{(L)}_1 - y_n)^2 \qquad \text {assuming MSE}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The output of the neural network is simply the signal of the final layer passed to that layer’s non-linear function <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ x^{(L)}_1 = \theta(s^{(L)}_1) \]</span></p>
<p>Due to the chain rule, we have to know the derivative of <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> in order to compute the partial partial derivative <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \theta&#39;(s) = 1 - \theta^2(s) \quad \text {for } \theta = \tanh \]</span></p>
<p>Now all that we have to do is back-propagate the final layer’s <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> to the previous layers. This is again facilitated by using the chain rule to break the partial derivative up into multiple components:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\delta^{(l - 1)}_i &amp;= \frac {\partial \crossentropy(\weight)} {\partial s^{(l)}_j} \\
&amp;= \sum_{j = 1}^{d^{(l)}} \frac {\partial \crossentropy(\weight)} {\partial s^{(l)}_j} \times
                          \frac {\partial s^{(l)}_j} {\partial x^{(l - 1)}_i} \times
                          \frac {\partial x^{(l - 1)}_i} {\partial s^{(l - 1)}_i} \\
&amp;= \sum_{j = 1}^{d^{(l)}} \delta^{(l)}_j \times w^{(l)}_{ij} \times \theta&#39;(s^{(l - 1)}_i) \\
&amp;= (1 - (x^{(l - 1)}_i)^2) \sum_{j = 1}^{d^{(l)}} w^{(l)}_{ij} \delta^{(l)}_j
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>This decomposition into three components is again observable from a diagram of a neural network layer:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/neural-networks/backpropagated-delta.png" class="center"></p>
<p>When the backpropagation is complete, there will be <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> values available at every position in the network where there is an <span class="math">\(s\)</span> value. The algorithm can now be formulated:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>initialize all weights <span class="math">\(w^{(l)}_{ij}\)</span> at random</li>
<li>for <span class="math">\(t = 0, 1, 2, \dots\)</span> do
<ol type="1">
<li>pick <span class="math">\(n \in \{ 1, 2, \dots, N\}\)</span></li>
<li><strong>forward</strong>: compute all <span class="math">\(x^{(l)}_j\)</span></li>
<li><strong>backward</strong>: compute all <span class="math">\(\delta^{(l)}_j\)</span></li>
<li>update the weights: <span class="math">\(w^{(l)}_{ij} \gets w^{(l)}_{ij} - \eta x^{(l - 1)}_i \delta^{(l)}_j\)</span></li>
<li>repeat until it is time to stop</li>
</ol></li>
<li>return the final weights <span class="math">\(w^{(l)}_{ij}\)</span></li>

<p>One final intuition is that the hidden layers are performing non-linear transformations which produce higher order features. However, these are features <em>learned</em> by the learning algorithm, with the <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension already taken into account. This allows us to avoid looking at the data to determine a proper non-linear transformation to perform explicitly and manually.</p>
<h1 id="overfitting">Overfitting</h1>
<p>Imagine that we are given five points along with the target function in blue. We can see that the target function doesn’t exactly fit some of the points, which means that there is some noise involved. If we were then to use a 4th-order polynomial, such as the one in red, to fit the points perfectly, we would get a very large <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> despite <span class="math">\(\insample = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/overfitting/polynomial-overfit.png" class="center"></p>
<p><em>Overfitting</em> is the act of fitting the data more than is warranted. It is a comparative term used to express that a solution went past a desirable point in terms of fitting, more so than another solution, where the different solutions can be different instances within the same model or different models entirely. For example, if we had used a 3rd-order polynomial instead, we would not have achieved <span class="math">\(\insample = 0\)</span> but <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> would have been considerably less. In that case, the 4th-order solution could have been considered overfitting compared to the 3rd-order solution. In other words, there is a distinction between overfitting and just plain bad generalization.</p>
<p>Overfitting within the same model occurs when <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> is decreasing but <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> is beginning to increase, that is, when both error measures begin to diverge:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \text {overfitting:} \quad \insample \downarrow \quad \outsample \uparrow \]</span></p>
<p>If we stop right before this occurs, we call it <em>early stopping</em>:</p>
<p><img id="early-stopping" src="/images/notes/machine-learning/overfitting/early-stopping.png" class="center"></p>
<p>The main culprit cause for overfitting is <em>fitting the noise</em>, which is a natural side-effect of fitting the data. Fitting the noise is harmful because the learning algorithm is forming its solution from it, trying to detect a pattern, and therefore “hallucinating” an out-of-sample solution extrapolated from the in-sample noise.</p>
<p>Consider two different target functions with accompanying data points. The first target on the left is a simpler 10th-order polynomial but has noise involved (noisy low-order target), whereas the one on the right is a more complicated 50th-order polynomial but is noiseless (noiseless high-order target):</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px">
<img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/overfitting/case-study-1.png"> <img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/overfitting/case-study-2.png">
</div>
<p>If we try to model the first target function using two models, a 2nd and 10th-order polynomial, we get this result:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/overfitting/case-study-1b.png" class="center"></p>
<p>The error measures clearly show that the 10th-order fit is a case of overfitting, showing the effects of how the 10th-order fit bends itself just to fit noise:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: left;">error</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">2nd-order</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">10th-order</th>

<td style="text-align: center;"><span class="math">\(9.00\)</span></td>

</table>
<p>Now we can try using the same order fits to model the second target function. Remember that the target is a 50th-order polynomial:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/overfitting/case-study-2b.png" class="center"></p>
<p>In this case, the 10th-order polynomial can fit the sample data very well, but the out of sample error is even worse. This is clearly another case of overfitting, because this target function actually <em>does</em> have noise, but it isn’t the usual kind of noise:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: left;">error</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">2nd-order</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">10th-order</th>

<td style="text-align: center;"><span class="math">\(7680\)</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In the case of the 10th-order target, we can think of the 2nd-order fit as learner <span class="math">\(R\)</span> (for restricted) and the 10th-order fit as learner <span class="math">\(O\)</span> (for overfit). It can be said that <span class="math">\(O\)</span> chose <span class="math">\(\mathcal H_{10}\)</span> because it knew that the target is a 10th-order polynomial. On the other hand, <span class="math">\(R\)</span> chose <span class="math">\(\mathcal H_2\)</span> because it considered the number of points available in the training set, <span class="math">\(15\)</span>. Choosing a 2nd-order polynomial provides three parameters, such that the ratio of points to degrees of freedom is 5:1, so we’re pushing our luck since we know the rule of thumb is for it to be 10:1, but we do so because we figure we can’t use a simple line when we <em>know</em> that the target is a 10th-order polynomial.</p>
<p>This reinforces the guideline that we are trying to match the data resources rather than the target complexity.</p>
<p>In the case of the 50th-order polynomial, <span class="math">\(O\)</span> chooses <span class="math">\(\mathcal H_{10}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(R\)</span> chooses <span class="math">\(\mathcal H_2\)</span>. We still got bad performance out of sample with <span class="math">\(O\)</span>, so is there really no noise?</p>
<h2 id="role-of-noise">Role of Noise</h2>
<p>We will conduct an experiment to observe the effects of overfitting, specifically to observe the impact of <em>noise level</em> and <em>target complexity</em>. Consider the general target function with added noise:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ y = f(x) + \underbrace {\epsilon(x)}_{\sigma^2} =
\underbrace {\sum_{q = 0}^{Q_f} \alpha_q x^q}_{\text {normalized}} + \epsilon(x) \]</span></p>
<p>The level (energy) of noise is denoted by <span class="math">\(\sigma^2\)</span>. This is a higher order <span class="math">\(Q_f\)</span> (target complexity) polynomial. We normalize the polynomial quantity such that the energy is always <span class="math">\(1\)</span>, since we want to observe the signal-to-noise ratio (<abbr title="Signal-to-Noise Ratio">SNR</abbr>), so that we can definitively say that <span class="math">\(\sigma^2\)</span> is really the amount of noise.</p>
<p>This function doesn’t generate very interesting polynomials, so we will instead use the coefficients of Legendre polynomials, which are simply polynomials with specific coefficients such that from one order to the next they are orthogonal to each other, similar to harmonics in a sinusoidal expansion. Once the noise is added, the polynomial formed will be more interesting.</p>
<p>Those factors that seem to affect overfitting are the noise level <span class="math">\(\sigma^2\)</span>, the target complexity <span class="math">\(Q_f\)</span>, and the data set size <span class="math">\(N\)</span>.</p>
<p>We fit the data set <span class="math">\((x_1, y_n), \dots, (x_N, y_N)\)</span> using our two models <span class="math">\(\mathcal H_2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mathcal H_{10}\)</span>, 2nd-order and 10th-order polynomials respectively. Each model yields a hypothesis function <span class="math">\(g_2 \in \mathcal H_2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g_{10} \in \mathcal H_{10}\)</span>. The overfit measure is then defined as the difference between <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> for the more complex model’s hypothesis <span class="math">\(g_{10}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> for the simpler model’s hypothesis <span class="math">\(g_2\)</span>. This works because if the more complex model is overfitting, its out of sample error will be bigger, yielding a larger positive number. If instead the measure yields a negative number, then it shows that the complex model is not overfitting because it’s performing better than the simpler model:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \text {overfit measure: } \outsample(g_{10}) - \outsample(g_2) \]</span></p>
<p>If we run an experiment for tens of millions of iterations (complete runs). The following plots show the impact of the noise <span class="math">\(\sigma^2\)</span> and the complexity <span class="math">\(Q_f\)</span> on the overfit measure based on the data set size <span class="math">\(N\)</span>:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px">
<img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/overfitting/noise-impact.png"> <img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/overfitting/complexity-impact.png">
</div>
<p>The main takeaway from these results is that there seems to be another factor aside from “conventional noise” that affects overfitting. The truth is that the noise <span class="math">\(\sigma^2\)</span> measured in the left image is called <em>stochastic noise</em> (the more conventional noise). Meanwhile, the effect observed in the right image which seems to be related to an increase in complexity that brings about a higher overfit measure is caused by <em>deterministic noise</em>.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\text {number of data points} &amp;\uparrow \quad \text {overfitting} \downarrow \\
\text {stochastic noise} &amp;\uparrow \quad \text {overfitting} \uparrow \\
\text {deterministic noise} &amp;\uparrow \quad \text {overfitting} \uparrow
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<h2 id="deterministic-noise">Deterministic Noise</h2>
<p><em>Deterministic noise</em> is the part of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> that the best hypothesis function <span class="math">\(h^*\)</span> from <span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span> cannot capture:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \text {deterministic noise:}\ f(\feature) - h^*(\feature) \]</span></p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/overfitting/deterministic-noise.png" class="center"></p>
<p>An example of why we call this noise is the following. Imagine a younger sibling that has just learned fractions in school and comes to you to ask you to tell them more about numbers. You begin to teach them about negative numbers and real numbers, in a basic sense, but you probably would be better off not telling them about complex numbers. The reason is that this would be considered completely noise from their perspective, their “hypothesis set” would be so small that if you told them about complex numbers, they would create a pattern that doesn’t actually exist (fitting the noise). You’d be better off not telling them about complex numbers in order to avoid misleading them (just as noise would in learning).</p>
<p>This is why if we have a hypothesis set and part of the target function that we can’t capture, there’s no point in trying to capture it, because then we would be detecting a false pattern which we cannot extrapolate given the limitations of the hypothesis set.</p>
<p>Deterministic noise differs from stochastic noise in that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>it depends on hypothesis set <span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span>; for the same target function, using a more sophisticated hypothesis set will decrease the deterministic noise</li>
<li>it’s fixed for a given <span class="math">\(\feature\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>When we have a finite <span class="math">\(N\)</span> set, we gain the unfortunate ability to fit the noise, be it stochastic or deterministic, which wouldn’t be possible if we had an infinite sized set.</p>
<h2 id="noise-and-bias-variance">Noise and Bias-Variance</h2>
<p>Remember that the <a href="#bias-variance-representation">bias-variance decomposition</a> concerned a noiseless target <span class="math">\(f\)</span>. So how would the decomposition work if <span class="math">\(f\)</span> were a noisy target?</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ y = f(\feature) + \epsilon(\feature) \qquad \mathbb E [\epsilon(\feature)] = 0 \]</span></p>
<p>We can decompose it into bias-variance by adding a noise term:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\mathbb E_{\mathcal D} \Big[ (g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x) - f(\mathbf x))^2 \Big] &amp;= \\
\mathbb E_{\mathcal D, \epsilon} \Big[ (g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x) - y)^2 \Big] &amp;=
\mathbb E_{\mathcal D, \epsilon} \Big[ (g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x) - f(\feature) - \epsilon(\feature))^2 \Big] \\
&amp;= \mathbb E_{\mathcal D, \epsilon} \Big[ (g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x) - \bar g(\feature) + \bar g(\feature) - f(\feature) - \epsilon(\feature))^2 \Big] \\
&amp;= \mathbb E_{\mathcal D, \epsilon} \Big[ (g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x) - \bar g(\feature))^2 + (\bar g(\feature) - f(\feature))^2 - (\epsilon(\feature))^2 \\
&amp; \phantom {= \mathbb E_\mathcal {D, \epsilon} \Big[} + \text {cross terms}\ \Big]
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Form this, we can derive the two noise terms. These can be described as moving from your hypothesis to the best possible hypothesis (variance), from the best possible hypothesis to the actual target (bias), and finally from the target to the actual output (with noise added):</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\underbrace {\mathbb E_{\mathcal D, \epsilon} \Big[ (g^{(\mathcal D)}(\mathbf x) - \bar g(\feature))^2 \Big]}_{\textbf {var}} +
\underbrace {\mathbb E_{\mathrm x} \Big[ (\bar g(\feature) - f(\feature))^2 \Big]}_{\substack {\textbf {bias} \\[5 pt] \uparrow \\[5 pt] \text {deterministic noise}}} +
\underbrace {\mathbb E_{\epsilon, \mathrm x} \Big[ (\epsilon(\feature))^2 \Big]}_{\substack {\sigma^2 \\[5 pt] \uparrow \\[5 pt] \text {stochastic noise}}}
\]</span></p>
<p>Notice that the bias consists of the deterministic noise. This is because the average hypothesis <span class="math">\(\bar g(\feature)\)</span> is supposed to be about the same as the best hypothesis, so the bias is a measure of how well the best hypothesis can approximate <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, which is effectively a measure of the energy of deterministic noise.</p>
<h2 id="dealing-with-overfitting">Dealing with Overfitting</h2>
<p>There are two cures for overfitting. <em>Regularization</em> can be described as hitting the breaks to avoid going into the point of overfitting. <em>Validation</em> on the other hand involves checking the bottom line and making sure it doesn’t overfit.</p>
<h1 id="regularization">Regularization</h1>
<p>Regularization tends to reduce the bias at the expense of slightly increasing the variance. Regularization can be thought of as providing intermediate levels between the different fits such as constant, linear, quadratic.</p>
<h2 id="polynomial-model">Polynomial Model</h2>
<p>The model <span class="math">\(\mathcal H_Q\)</span> consists of the polynomials of order <span class="math">\(Q\)</span>. A non-linear transformation produces <span class="math">\(\mathbf z\)</span> by taking a scalar <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. In effect, the elements in <span class="math">\(\mathbf z\)</span> correspond to the coefficients of the Legendre polynomials. The parameterization of the hypothesis set is therefore represented as the linear combination of the weights and the Legendre polynomial coefficients:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\mathbf z = \begin{bmatrix}
              1 \\ L_1(x) \\ \vdots \\ L_Q(x)
            \end{bmatrix}, \quad
\mathcal H_Q = \left\{ \sum_{q = 0}^Q w_q L_q(x) \right\}
\]</span></p>
<p>The Legendre polynomials denoted by <span class="math">\(L_q\)</span> look like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/regularization/legendre-polynomials.png" class="center"></p>
<p>Because of the summation, we’re going to apply linear regression in the <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space.</p>
<p>We’ve already placed a <em>hard</em> constraint on the weights in the previous section, in which case <span class="math">\(\mathcal H_2\)</span> was the constrained version of <span class="math">\(\mathcal H_{10}\)</span>. This is represented in the polynomial model by having set <span class="math">\(w_q = 0\)</span> for <span class="math">\(q &gt; 2\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, we’d like more of a <em>softer</em> constraint. Given a budget <span class="math">\(C\)</span> for the total magnitude squared of the weights, <span class="math">\(w_q^2\)</span>. Instead of the harder constraint above where we outright set some of the weights to <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, we just want them to be generally small. This can be thought of as a <em>soft-order</em> constraint:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \sum_{q = 0}^Q w_q^2 \leq C \]</span></p>
<p>Given this model, we now want to minimize <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> while <em>being subject to</em> the constraint (shown in vector form):</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\text {minimize:} &amp;\insample(\weight) = \frac 1 N (\mathbf {Zw - y})^\intercal (\mathbf {Zw - y}) \\[5 pt]
&amp;\text {subject to:} \quad \weightT \weight \leq C
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The solution will be called <span class="math">\(\def \weightreg {\weight_{\text {reg}}} \weightreg\)</span>, which signifies regularization, as opposed to <span class="math">\(\def \weightlin {\weight_{\text {lin}}} \weightlin\)</span> which signifies linear regression.</p>
<p>The solution can be visualized by an ellipsoid. The in-sample error <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> is represented by the blue ellipsoid. The boundary of the ellipsoid consists of the same value for <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span>. Anything inside the boundary is a smaller value and outside is larger. The value of <span class="math">\(\weightT \weight\)</span> is represented by the red ellipsoid, so the constraint means that we have to be inside the red ellipsoid. The solution given by linear regression <span class="math">\(\weightlin\)</span> is at the centroid of the blue ellipsoid, since it minimizes <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span>. Since we want to choose a point within the red ellipsoid such that it minimizes <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span>, it stands to reason that we’ll have to go as far out as we can within the red ellipsoid. Therefore, the constraint we’ll actually be using is <span class="math">\(\weightT \weight = C\)</span>, since the best value of <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> will occur at the boundary of the red ellipsoid. Of course, if the red ellipsoid was large enough to contain <span class="math">\(\weightlin\)</span>, then the solution would be <span class="math">\(\weightlin\)</span> since that is the minimum:</p>
<p><img id="solution-visualization" src="/images/notes/machine-learning/regularization/solution-visualization.png" class="center"></p>
<p>Choose a <span class="math">\(\weight\)</span> that lies on both of the ellipsoid boundaries. From here, we can visualize the gradient of <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> with respect to the chosen point as well as the orthogonal vector to the red ellipsoid. The orthogonal vector to the red ellipsoid is equivalent to <span class="math">\(\weight\)</span> (from the center). From visualizing these vectors, we can tell that the chosen point below doesn’t minimize <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span>. If it did minimize <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span>, then both vectors would be directly opposite each other:</p>
<p><img id="solution-vectors" src="/images/notes/machine-learning/regularization/solution-vectors.png" class="center"></p>
<p>A condition can therefore be expressed that the gradient of the solution <span class="math">\(\weightreg\)</span> when found should be proportional to the negation of <span class="math">\(\weightreg\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\nabla \insample(\weightreg) &amp;\propto -\weightreg \\
&amp;= -2 \frac \lambda N \weightreg \\
\nabla \insample(\weightreg) &amp;+ -2 \frac \lambda N \weightreg = \mathbf 0
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The solution of the last equation is simply the minimization of the following:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \insample(\weight) + \frac \lambda N \weightT \weight \]</span></p>
<p>The values of <span class="math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> are related, so that if <span class="math">\(C\)</span> is so big it already contains <span class="math">\(\weightlin\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> can be thought of as being <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, and corresponding to the simple minimization of <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span>. When <span class="math">\(C\)</span> is smaller, <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> has to go up:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ C \uparrow \quad \lambda \downarrow \]</span></p>
<h2 id="augmented-error">Augmented Error</h2>
<p>We’re now going to consider an augmented error <span class="math">\(\def \augerror {E_{\text {aug}}} \augerror\)</span> that is essentially <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> augmented with the regularization term:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\augerror(\weight) &amp;= \insample(\weight) + \frac \lambda N \weightT \weight \\
&amp;= \frac 1 N (\mathbf {Zw - y})^\intercal (\mathbf {Zw - y}) + \frac \lambda N
\weightT \weight
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The key observation is that solving the above equation is equivalent to minimizing <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> <em>subject to</em> the constraint <span class="math">\(\weightT \weight \leq C\)</span>. This constraint lends itself to <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> analysis.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\augerror(\weight) &amp;= \insample(\weight) + \frac \lambda N \weightT \weight \\
&amp;= \frac 1 N \left( (\mathbf {Zw - y})^\intercal (\mathbf {Zw - y}) + \lambda \weightT \weight \right)
\end{align}
\]</span> To minimize this, we take the gradient of <span class="math">\(\augerror\)</span> and equate it to <span class="math">\(\mathbf 0\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\nabla \augerror(\weight) &amp;= \mathbf 0 \\
\mathbf Z^\intercal (\mathbf {Zw - y}) + \lambda \weight &amp;= \mathbf 0
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>So now this results in the weight vector with regularization, <span class="math">\(\weightreg\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \weightreg = (\mathbf Z^\intercal \mathbf Z + \lambda \mathbf I)^{-1} \mathbf Z^\intercal \mathbf y \]</span></p>
<p>This is opposed to the weight vector <em>without</em> regularization, <span class="math">\(\weightlin\)</span>, which can be achieved by simply setting <span class="math">\(\lambda = 0\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \weightlin = (\mathbf Z^\intercal \mathbf Z)^{-1} \mathbf Z^\intercal \mathbf y \]</span></p>
<p>We can now observe the effects of varying <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>. In the first example, there is apparent overfitting. However, as <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> increased, there is apparent underfitting. Clearly, the choice of <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> is important:</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px">
<img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/regularization/lambda-variation-1.png"> <img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/regularization/lambda-variation-2.png">
</div>
<h2 id="weight-decay">Weight Decay</h2>
<p>The name of the regularizer that involves minimizing the following quantity is referred to as <em>weight ‘decay’</em>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \insample(\weight) + \frac \lambda N \weightT \weight \]</span></p>
<p>For example, in batch gradient descent, we take a step from <span class="math">\(\weight(t)\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\weight(t + 1)\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\weight(t + 1) &amp;= \weight(t) - \eta \nabla \insample(\weight(t)) - 2 \eta \frac \lambda N \weight(t) \\
&amp;= \weight(t) \underbrace {(1 - 2 \eta \frac \lambda N)}_{\text {nudge factor}} - \eta \nabla \insample(\weight(t))
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>This can be interpreted geometrically. In the usual implementation of batch gradient descent we have the previous step <span class="math">\(\weight(t)\)</span> that is moved in the direction of the gradient <span class="math">\(\nabla \insample\)</span>. However, this now includes a regularization term which can be interpreted as a nudge factor. That is, it takes the previous position, nudges it a bit based on <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>, and <em>then</em> performs the gradient descent. This is why the regularizer is called weight decay, because the weights decay from one iteration to the next.</p>
<p>In neural networks, the term <span class="math">\(\weightT \weight\)</span> can be computed by considering all of the weights in all of the layers, input units, and output units and squaring them and summing them up:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \weightT \weight = \sum_{l = 1}^L \sum_{i = 0}^{d^{(l - 1)}} \sum_{j = 1}^{d^{(l)}} \left( \neuronweight \right)^2 \]</span></p>
<h3 id="variations-of-weight-decay">Variations</h3>
<p>Instead of having a fixed budget <span class="math">\(C\)</span> and having the sum of the squared weights being less than or equal to <span class="math">\(C\)</span>, we could emphasize certain weights by using this regularizer:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \sum_{q = 0}^Q \gamma_q w_q^2 \]</span></p>
<p>Here, <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> is referred to as the <em>importance factor</em>. For example, if a particular <span class="math">\(\gamma_q\)</span> is small then the equivalent weight <span class="math">\(w_q\)</span> is less restricted; it can be made larger while knowing it won’t take up too much of the budget <span class="math">\(C\)</span>. On the other hand, if a particular <span class="math">\(\gamma_q\)</span> is big, then the corresponding weight doesn’t have that luxury.</p>
<p>For example, imagine that <span class="math">\(\gamma_q\)</span> is set to <span class="math">\(2^q\)</span>. In this case, the regularizer is giving a larger emphasis on higher order terms. What this means is that the regularizer is trying to find a <em>low-order fit</em>. For example, a 10th-order polynomial would quickly kill the budget because <span class="math">\(\gamma_{10} = 2^{10}\)</span>. If instead we had <span class="math">\(\gamma_q\)</span> set to <span class="math">\(2^{-q}\)</span>, it would look for a <em>high-order fit</em>.</p>
<p>In neural networks, the importance factor <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> is given different values for each each layer, in other words, giving different emphasis for the weights in different layers.</p>
<p>The most general regularizer is called the <em>Tikhonov regularizer</em>, which has the form:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \weightT \mathbf \Gamma^\intercal \mathbf \Gamma \weight \]</span></p>
<p>This is a general quadratic in matrix form. Weight decay, low-order fits, high-order fits, and many other regularizations can be achieved given the proper choice of matrix <span class="math">\(\mathbf \Gamma\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="weight-growth">Weight Growth</h2>
<p>Just as big weights were constrained earlier, small weights can also be constrained. The following shows a plot of weight decay’s <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> as a function of the regularization parameter <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>. Notice that it dips before it goes back up again, in which case it begins to underfit. This means that weight decay performs well <em>given</em> the correct choice of <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>. Weight growth on the other hand—constraining weights to be large—is considerably worse.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/regularization/regularizers.png" class="center"></p>
<p>Stochastic noise is “high-frequency”. Deterministic noise is also non-smooth. Because of these common observations, the guideline is to <strong>constrain learning towards smoother hypotheses</strong>. This is because the regularizer is a cure for fitting the noise. For this reason, we want to punish the noise more than we are punishing the signal. The usual way that hypothesis sets are mathematically written as a parameterized set is by having smaller weights correspond to smoother hypotheses.</p>
<h2 id="generalized-regularizer">Generalized Regularizer</h2>
<p>The regularizer will be referred to as <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \Omega = \Omega(h) \]</span></p>
<p>We will minimize the augmented error of the hypothesis:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \augerror(h) = \insample(h) + \frac \lambda N \Omega(h) \]</span></p>
<p>This looks similar to the <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \outsample(h) \leq \insample(h) + \Omega(\mathcal H) \]</span></p>
<p>From this, we make the claim that <span class="math">\(\augerror\)</span> is better than <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> as a proxy of <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span>.</p>
<p>The perfect regularizer is one that restricts in the “direction” of the target function. Regularization generically applies a methodology which harms the overfitting (fitting the noise) more than it harms the fitting (fitting the guideline), therefore it’s a <em>heuristic</em>. For this reason, we move in the direction of <em>smoother</em> or “simpler” because the noise itself <strong>is not</strong> smooth. For example, in the case of movie ratings, this kind of regularization guideline tends to opt for the average rating in the absence of enough examples.</p>
<p>If we choose a bad regularizer <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span>, we still have <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> that can save us by means of validation, which can set <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> such that it completely ignores the bad regularizer <span class="math">\(\Omega\)</span>. In any case, having a regularizer is necessary to avoid overfitting.</p>
<h2 id="neural-network-regularizers">Neural Network Regularizers</h2>
<p>Remember that the <a href="#tanh"><span class="math">\(\tanh\)</span></a> function acts linear for small value ranges and binary for larger value ranges.</p>
<h3 id="neural-network-weight-decay">Weight Decay</h3>
<p>If we use small weights, then the signal is constrained to the range that produces linear-like values, so every neuron would essentially be computing the linear function. With multiple hidden layers in a neural network, this essentially becomes a complex neural network that is computing a very simple linear function.</p>
<p>If weights are increased to the maximum, <span class="math">\(\tanh\)</span> outputs binary values, which results in a logical dependency that can be used to implement any kind of functionality.</p>
<p>Given these two extremes, it’s apparent that as weights are increased, the model produces more complex models. This represents a clear correspondence between the simplicity of the function being implemented and the size of the weights, which is properly represented by <em>weight decay</em>.</p>
<h3 id="neural-network-weight-elimination">Weight Elimination</h3>
<p><em>Weight elimination</em> works by remembering that the <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension of neural networks is more or less the number of weights, so it simply eliminates some of the weights by forcing them to be <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, so that the number of free parameters decreases, as does the <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension, leading to a better chance of generalizing and less chance of overfitting.</p>
<p>Determining which weights to eliminate can is a combinatorial problem. <em>Soft weight elimination</em> is an optimization of weight elimination. For very small weights, regular weight decay is applied. For very large weights, the result is close to <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. In other words, big weights are left alone and small weights are pushed towards <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, or “soft eliminated”:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\Omega(\weight) = \sum_{i,j,l} \frac {\left( \neuronweight \right)^2} {\beta^2 + \left( \neuronweight \right)^2}
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="neural-network-early-stopping">Early Stopping</h3>
<p>Recall that <a href="#early-stopping">early stopping</a> consists of stopping before <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> begins to increase. This is regularization through the optimizer. The point at which to stop is determined through <a href="#validation">validation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="optimal-lambda">Optimal <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span></h2>
<p>Observing the optimal value of <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> given the different levels of noise provides some insight as to how deterministic noise is treated by the regularizer compared to how it treats stochastic noise.</p>
<p>As the level of <em>stochastic noise</em> <span class="math">\(\sigma^2\)</span> increases, the level of regularization <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> necessary to achieve the minimum <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> increases. For example, when there is no noise, the minimum <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> can be achieved with <span class="math">\(\lambda = 0\)</span>. However, as the noise increases, regularization is <em>necessary</em> to achieve the best possible <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span>. The left side of the red and green curves represent the overfitting that occurs without regularization.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/regularization/lambda-for-stochastic-noise.png" class="center"></p>
<p>The same behavior is observed as the level of <em>deterministic noise</em> <span class="math">\(Q_f\)</span> (complexity of the target function) increases.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/regularization/lambda-for-stochastic-noise.png" class="center"></p>
<p>This cements the correspondence that regularization behaves with respect to deterministic noise behaves almost exactly as if it were unknown stochastic noise.</p>
<h1 id="validation">Validation</h1>
<p>Remember that regularization tried to estimate the “overfit penalty;” so that instead of minimizing just <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> it would minimize <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> plus the overfit penalty, a quantity known as the augmented error <span class="math">\(\augerror\)</span>. <em>Validation</em> instead tries to estimate the actual <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> and tries to minimize it directly.</p>
<p>To arrive at this estimate, we first find an out-of-sample point <span class="math">\((\weight, y)\)</span>, that is, a point that was not involved in training, otherwise known as a <em>validation point</em>. The error for this point is <span class="math">\(\crossentropy(h(\weight), y)\)</span>. The error itself could be the squared error, binary error, etc., and we consider it to be an estimate of <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span>, which we can do because:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\mathbb E \left[ \crossentropy(h(\weight), y) \right] = \outsample(h)\]</span></p>
<p>This is an unbiased estimate of <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span>. The variance is known as <span class="math">\(\sigma^2\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\text {var} \left[ \crossentropy(h(\weight), y) \right] = \sigma^2\]</span></p>
<p>The variance of estimating <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> from a single point would be very high, so instead of calculating this estimate from a single point, we do it from an entire <em>validation set</em> <span class="math">\((\weight_1, y_1), \dots, (\weight_K, y_K)\)</span>. Notice that the total number of points in the validation set is <span class="math">\(K\)</span>, as opposed to <span class="math">\(N\)</span> in the training set. The validation error derived from this validation set is known as <span class="math">\(\def \valerror {E_{\text {val}}} \valerror\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\valerror(h) = \frac 1 K \sum_{k = 1}^K \crossentropy(h(\weight_k), y_k)\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore the expected value of <span class="math">\(\valerror\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\mathbb E \left[ \valerror(h) \right] = \frac 1 K \sum_{k = 1}^K \mathbb E \left[ \crossentropy(h(\weight_k), y_k) \right] = \outsample(h)\]</span></p>
<p>The variance is computed as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\text {var} \left[ \valerror(h) \right] = \frac 1 {K^2} \sum_{k = 1}^K \text {var} \left[ \crossentropy(h(\weight_k), y_k) \right] = \frac {\sigma^2} K\]</span></p>
<p>The validation error:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\valerror(h) = \outsample(h) \pm O\left(\frac 1 {\sqrt K}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>Given the data set <span class="math">\(\mathcal D = (\weight_1, y_1), \dots, (\weight_N, y_N)\)</span>, take <span class="math">\(K\)</span> points at random and use them for validation, which leaves <span class="math">\(N - K\)</span> for training. The set of <span class="math">\(N - K\)</span> training points is called <span class="math">\(\def \trainingset {\mathcal D_{\text {train}}}\)</span> and the set of <span class="math">\(K\)</span> validation points is called <span class="math">\(\def \validationset {\mathcal D_{\text {val}}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We established that the reliability of the estimate of the validation set is of the order <span class="math">\(\smash {\frac 1 {\sqrt K}}\)</span>, so the smaller the size <span class="math">\(K\)</span> of the validation set, the worse off the estimate is. On the other hand, if we use a very large <span class="math">\(K\)</span> we would get a reliable estimate of a worse quantity of <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span>, because the <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> decreases with the increase in training set size, the size of which must decrease if we increase the validation set size.</p>
<p>We would instead like to estimate the error using the validation set, then once we have the estimate, return the <span class="math">\(K\)</span> points to the training set. We begin by deciding that the data set <span class="math">\(\mathcal D\)</span> is comprised of <span class="math">\(\trainingset \cup \validationset\)</span>. Previously when we used the entire training set <span class="math">\(\mathcal D\)</span> we arrived at the final hypothesis <span class="math">\(g\)</span>. However, when using only <span class="math">\(\trainingset\)</span>, we will call the resulting final hypothesis <span class="math">\(g^-\)</span> to remind ourselves that it’s not based on the full training set.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\trainingset\)</span> yields <span class="math">\(g^-\)</span> which is then evaluated on <span class="math">\(\validationset\)</span> in order to get the estimate <span class="math">\(\valerror(g^-)\)</span>. Then the final hypothesis <span class="math">\(g\)</span> is derived using the full set <span class="math">\(\mathcal D\)</span>. This means that there will be a discrepancy between the estimate <span class="math">\(\valerror(g^-)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\valerror(g)\)</span>, because they are based on different hypotheses, as derived from different training sets. This presents a trade off between the size of <span class="math">\(\trainingset\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\validationset\)</span>: a larger <span class="math">\(\trainingset\)</span> means that the hypothesis more closely resembles the final hypothesis, but a subsequently smaller <span class="math">\(\validationset\)</span> makes the estimate a poor one, even if the hypothesis <span class="math">\(g^-\)</span> is representative of the final hypothesis <span class="math">\(g\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/validation/validation.png" class="center"></p>
<p>The <em>rule of thumb</em> for the choice of the size <span class="math">\(K\)</span> of <span class="math">\(\validationset\)</span> is to make it <span class="math">\(1/4^{\text {th}}\)</span> the size of of the full set <span class="math">\(\mathcal D\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[K = \frac N 5\]</span></p>
<h2 id="purpose-of-validation">Purpose of Validation</h2>
<p>Looking back at the <a href="#early-stopping">early stopping</a> curve, if we used <span class="math">\(K\)</span> points to estimate <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> then the estimate would be called <span class="math">\(E_{\text {test}}\)</span> <em>if</em> we don’t perform any actions based on this estimate. As soon as we decide to perform an action based on it, such as stopping, then the previous <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> is considered the <em>validation error</em>, because it is now considered to be biased. The difference is that the test set is unbiased, whereas the validation set has an optimistic bias.</p>
<p>For example, given two hypotheses <span class="math">\(h_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(h_2\)</span> with <span class="math">\(\outsample(h_1) = \outsample(h_2) = 0.5\)</span> and error estimates <span class="math">\(\crossentropy_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\crossentropy_2\)</span> that are uniform on <span class="math">\([0,1]\)</span>. Now pick <span class="math">\(h \in \{h_1, h_2\}\)</span> based on <span class="math">\(\crossentropy = \min(\crossentropy_1, \crossentropy_2)\)</span>. The value of <span class="math">\(\mathbb E(\crossentropy) &lt; 0.5\)</span>, because given two variables, the probability that one of them is <span class="math">\(&lt; 0.5\)</span> is <span class="math">\(75\%\)</span>, since the probability that both them are <span class="math">\(0.5\)</span> is <span class="math">\(0.5 * 0.5 = 25\%\)</span>. This means that <span class="math">\(\mathbb E(\crossentropy)\)</span> is an optimistic bias. This bias has a negligible effect on overall learning.</p>
<h2 id="model-selection">Model Selection</h2>
<p>The main use of validation sets is model selection, which is accomplished by using <span class="math">\(\validationset\)</span> more than once. We begin with <span class="math">\(M\)</span> models <span class="math">\(\mathcal {H_1, \dots, H_M}\)</span> to choose from. This could be models such as linear models, neural networks, support vector machines, etc. It could also be that we’re only using polynomial models, in which case the question is whether to use 2nd, 3rd, 4th-order etc. It could also be that we’re only using 5th-order polynomials, in which case the question is the value of <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> being for example <span class="math">\(0.01, 0.1\)</span> or <span class="math">\(1.0\)</span>. All of this falls under model selection, based on <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> by means of <span class="math">\(\validationset\)</span>.</p>
<p>Then we will use <span class="math">\(\trainingset\)</span> to learn <span class="math">\(g_m^-\)</span> for each model. The hypothesis <span class="math">\(g_m^-\)</span> is then evaluated using <span class="math">\(\validationset\)</span> to derive <span class="math">\(E_{\text m}\)</span>, which is simply <span class="math">\(\valerror(g_m^-)\)</span>. The model with the smallest <span class="math">\(E_{\text m}\)</span> is chosen as the optimal model <span class="math">\(m^*\)</span>, which is then used to train on the entire dataset <span class="math">\(\mathcal D\)</span> to derive the hypothesis <span class="math">\(g_{m^*}\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/validation/model-selection.png" class="center"></p>
<h2 id="validation-bias">Bias</h2>
<p>The bias is introduced because we chose the model <span class="math">\(\mathcal H_{m^*}\)</span> using <span class="math">\(\validationset\)</span>, so <span class="math">\(\valerror(g_{m^*}^-)\)</span> is a biased estimate of <span class="math">\(\outsample(g_{m^*}^-)\)</span>. The following graph depicts two models to choose between, one being 2nd-order and the other 5th-order polynomials. It’s not shown which model was chosen.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/validation/validation-bias.png" class="center"></p>
<p>The curve for <span class="math">\(\valerror\)</span> goes up because the higher the <span class="math">\(K\)</span>, the less points that are left for <span class="math">\(\trainingset\)</span>. The curve for <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> goes up because it is based on the number of points left in <span class="math">\(\trainingset\)</span>, so the error increases as there are less and less points.</p>
<p>The curve for <span class="math">\(\valerror\)</span> converges with <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span> because <span class="math">\(K\)</span> is increasing, which means that the estimate <span class="math">\(\valerror\)</span> is more and more accurate.</p>
<p>It can be considered that <span class="math">\(\validationset\)</span> is actually used for “training” on a very special kind of hypothesis set, known as the <em>finalists model</em>, which consists of the hypotheses derived from each model:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\mathcal H_{\text {val}} = \{g_1^-, g_2^-, \dots, g_M^-\}\]</span></p>
<p>Now when we measure the bias between <span class="math">\(\valerror\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(\valerror\)</span> can be thought of as the training error of this special set <span class="math">\(\mathcal H_{\text {val}}\)</span>. This means we can go back to Hoeffding and <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr>, to say that:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\outsample(g_{m^*}^-) \leq \valerror(g_{m^*}^-) +
O\left( \sqrt {\frac {\ln M} K} \right)
\]</span></p>
<p>If for example we’re trying to determine the value of <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>, it can be thought of as being able to take on an infinite number of values, however, instead it can be though of as being a single parameter, which according to the <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> inequality is not a problem. This applies to regularization which is trying to determine the value for the single parameter <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>, or early-stopping which is trying to determine the value for the single parameter <span class="math">\(T\)</span> (number of epochs to perform). In both cases, they more or less correspond to having one degree of freedom.</p>
<h2 id="data-contamination">Data Contamination</h2>
<p>The error estimates encountered so far have been <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span>, <span class="math">\(E_{\text {test}}\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\valerror\)</span>. These can be described as data contaminations, where if the data is used to make choices, it is being contaminated as far as its ability to estimate the real performance. In this sense, <em>contamination</em> is the optimistic (deceptive) bias in estimating <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span>.</p>
<p>The training set is totally contaminated. For example, if it’s put through a neural network with 70 parameters that yielded a very low <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span>, we can be assured that <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> is no indication of <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span>, in which case <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> can’t be relied upon as an estimate for <span class="math">\(\outsample\)</span>.</p>
<p>The validation set is slightly contaminated because it made a few choices.</p>
<p>The test set, on the other hand, is completely clean, since it wasn’t used in any decisions, so it is unbiased.</p>
<h2 id="cross-validation">Cross-Validation</h2>
<p>We would like to know the actual <span class="math">\(\outsample(g)\)</span>, but we only have <span class="math">\(\valerror(g^-)\)</span>, which is supposed to be an estimate for <span class="math">\(\outsample(g^-)\)</span>. Therefore it is necessary for <span class="math">\(K\)</span> to be small so that <span class="math">\(g^-\)</span> is fairly close to <span class="math">\(g\)</span>, since the bigger <span class="math">\(K\)</span> is, the larger the discrepancy between the training set and the full set, and therefore larger the discrepancy between <span class="math">\(g^-\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g\)</span>. This creates a <em>dilemma</em> because we would like <span class="math">\(K\)</span> to be large, to increase the reliability of <span class="math">\(\valerror(g^-)\)</span> as an estimate for <span class="math">\(\outsample(g^-)\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\outsample(g) \approx \outsample(g^-) \approx \valerror(g^-)\]</span></p>
<p>It’s possible to achieve both constraints by using a technique called <em>leave one out</em>. First choose <span class="math">\(N - 1\)</span> points for training and <span class="math">\(1\)</span> point for validation. The training set <span class="math">\(\mathcal D_n\)</span> is denoted by the point that was <span class="math">\(n\)</span> that was left out:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\mathcal D_n = (\feature_1, y_1), \dots, (\feature_{n - 1}, y_{n - 1}), \underbrace {(\feature_n, y_n)}_{\text {validation point}}, (\feature_{n + 1}, y_{n + 1}), \dots, (\feature_N, y_N)\]</span></p>
<p>The final hypothesis learned from <span class="math">\(\mathcal D_n\)</span> is called <span class="math">\(g_n^-\)</span>, since it was trained on all examples except <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. The validation error is then defined as simply the error on the left-out point using the hypothesis derived from the set that excludes that point. We can be sure that this estimate is an unbiased estimate, albeit a bad estimate:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\crossentropy_n = \valerror(g_n^-) = \crossentropy(g_n^-(\weight_n), y_n)\]</span></p>
<p>This can then be repeated for every point in the data set using every <span class="math">\(\mathcal D_n\)</span>. What is common between every error measure is that it was computed using the hypothesis derived using a training set of <span class="math">\(N - 1\)</span> points, albeit different points.</p>
<p>The <em>cross validation error</em> is then defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\def \crossvalidation {E_{\text {ev}}}
\crossvalidation = \frac 1 N \sum_{n = 1}^N \crossentropy_n
\]</span></p>
<p>The effective size of the validation set represented by the cross validation error is very close to <span class="math">\(N\)</span>.</p>
<p>For example, given three points, we train three different sets:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/validation/cross-validation.png" class="center"></p>
<p>The cross validation error can then be defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\crossvalidation = \frac 1 3 (\crossentropy_1 + \crossentropy_2 + \crossentropy_3)\]</span></p>
<p>This cross validation error can then be interpreted as how well the linear model fits the data <em>out of sample</em>.</p>
<p>Cross-validation can then be used for model selection. Compare the above linear model example with the constant model:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/validation/cross-validation-model-selection.png" class="center"></p>
<p>In this case, the constant model is clearly better.</p>
<p>Going back to the case of hand-written digits classification, where we extracted two features: symmetry and intensity. We will sample 500 points for training and the rest for testing the hypothesis. The non-linear transformation is 5th-order:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ (1, x_1, x_2) \to (1, x_1, x_2, x^2_1, x_1 x_2, x_2^2, x_1^3, x_1^2 x_2, \dots, x_1^5, x_1^4 x_2, x_1^3 x_2^2, x_1^2 x_2^3, x_1 x_2^4, x_2^5) \]</span></p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/validation/digits-classification.png" class="center"></p>
<p>In this case, we would like to use cross-validation to determine at which point to cut off the non-linear transformation, that is how many terms to use, where each term in the non-linear transformation is considered a separate model, for a total of <span class="math">\(20\)</span> different models. Here are the different errors derived based on the number of features used:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/validation/digits-classification-2.png" class="center"></p>
<p>From this graph it seems that the best number of features to use is 6. Without validation (left) we can observe overfitting with no in-sample error and <span class="math">\(2.5\%\)</span> out-of sample error, whereas with validation (right) provides a smooth surface with non-zero in-sample error but lower out-of-sample error at <span class="math">\(1.5\%\)</span>.</p>

<h2 id="cross-validation-optimization">Optimization</h2>
<p>When we use leave one out, we have <span class="math">\(N\)</span> training sessions on <span class="math">\(N - 1\)</span> points each. We would like to use more points for validation. We take the data and break it into different folds, such as 10 folds, making it 10-fold cross-validation. We use one fold for validation and the other 9 for training. In other words, it’s similar to leave one out except instead of leaving one point out we leave out a chunk/fold.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/validation/leave-more-than-one-out.png" class="center"></p>
<p>This results in <span class="math">\(\frac N K\)</span> training sessions on <span class="math">\(N - K\)</span> points each. Specifically, <em>10-fold cross validation</em> is very useful in practice.</p>
<h1 id="support-vector-machines">Support Vector Machines</h1>
<p>Going back to the concept of <a href="#dichotomies">dichotomies</a>, when we wanted to determine the number of ways in which a model could separate data in different configurations. With the linear model, we ignored the actual position and angle of the line that separated the data, only caring for different resultant configurations.</p>
<p>However, if we did care about the position and angle of the line, it could be said that a distinguishing factor of every such line position and angle would be its margin of error, that is, its distance between the data it separates. A higher margin of error makes it more tolerant to out-of-sample data, due to noise for example. We can enforce a lower bound requirement on the margin of error, which naturally would result in less dichotomies, as it places a restriction on the growth function, yielding a smaller <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/support-vector-machines/margin-dichotomies.png" class="center"></p>
<p>In the scenario in which we would like to enforce a lower bound on the margin of error, the problem of learning then becomes that of finding the <span class="math">\(\weight\)</span> that maximizes the margin.</p>
<p>To find the <span class="math">\(\weight\)</span> with a large margin we first pick <span class="math">\(\feature_n\)</span> that is the nearest data point to the hyperplane <span class="math">\(\weightT \feature = 0\)</span>. We would like to determine the distance between the point and this hyperplane, which would represent the margin.</p>
<p>First we normalize <span class="math">\(\weight\)</span> with the following constraint, where <span class="math">\(\feature_n\)</span> again represents the nearest point to the hyperplane:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[|\weightT \feature_n| = 1\]</span></p>
<p>Second we have to take out <span class="math">\(w_0\)</span>, the threshold/bias weight, from now on referred to as <span class="math">\(b\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\weight = (w_1, \dots, w_d)\]</span></p>
<p>Now the hyperplane is defined as follows, with <span class="math">\(x_0\)</span> absent since it was always <span class="math">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(w_0\)</span> was taken out as <span class="math">\(b\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\weightT \feature + b = 0\]</span></p>
<p>We can now compute the distance between <span class="math">\(\feature_n\)</span> and the plane <span class="math">\(\weightT \feature + b = 0\)</span> where <span class="math">\(|\weightT \feature_n + b| = 1\)</span>. First we must realize that the vector <span class="math">\(\weight\)</span> is perpendicular to the plane in <span class="math">\(\mathcal X\)</span>-space. For example, pick any <span class="math">\(\feature&#39;\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\feature&#39;&#39;\)</span> on the plane. Since they’re on the plane, they must satisfy the plane equation so that:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\weightT \feature&#39; + b &amp;= 0 \\
\weightT \feature&#39;&#39; + b &amp;= 0 \\
\Longrightarrow \weightT (\feature&#39; - \feature&#39;&#39;) &amp;= 0
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The conclusion from the above is that <span class="math">\(\weight\)</span> is orthogonal to any vector on the plane.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/support-vector-machines/plane.png" class="center"></p>
<p>The distance between the nearest point <span class="math">\(\feature_n\)</span> and the plane can be computed by taking any point <span class="math">\(\feature\)</span> on the plane and computing the projection of the vector formed by <span class="math">\(\feature_n - \feature\)</span> on <span class="math">\(\weight\)</span>. In order to get this projection, we need the unit vector of <span class="math">\(\weight\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\hat \weight = \frac \weight {\lVert \weight \rVert}\]</span></p>
<p>So that now the distance can be computed as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\text {distance } &amp;= |\hat \weight \cdot (\feature_n - \feature)| \\
\text {distance } &amp;= \frac 1 {\lVert \weight \rVert}
|\weightT \feature_n - \weightT \feature| \\
\text {distance } &amp;= \frac 1 {\lVert \weight \rVert}
|\weightT \feature_n + b - \weightT \feature - b| \\
\text {distance } &amp;= \frac 1 {\lVert \weight \rVert}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The last component of the penultimate equation disappears because the equation for a point on the plane is defined to be <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, and we already restricted the equation for <span class="math">\(\feature_n\)</span> to be equal to <span class="math">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/support-vector-machines/distance.png" class="center"></p>
<p>The resulting optimization problem is to maximize the margin, denoted as <span class="math">\(\smash {\frac 1 {\lVert \weight \rVert}}\)</span> subject to the following constraint:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\min_{n = 1, 2, \dots, N} |\weightT \feature_n + b| = 1
\]</span></p>
<p>However, this is not a friendly optimization problem because it has a <span class="math">\(\min\)</span> in it. To get rid of the absolute value, notice that:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[|\weightT \feature_n + b| = y_n(\weightT \feature_n + b)\]</span></p>
<p>Now instead of maximizing <span class="math">\(\smash {\frac 1 {\lVert \weight \rVert}}\)</span> we will minimize the following quantity:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\text {minimize }\colon&amp; \frac 1 2 \weightT \weight \\
\text {subject to }\colon&amp; y_n(\weightT \feature_n + b) \geq 1 \quad \text {for } n = 1, 2, \dots, N \\
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The domain of this optimization problem is <span class="math">\(\weight \in \mathbb R^d, b \in \mathbb R\)</span>. This is therefore a constrained optimization problem, for which we can use Lagrange, but the problem is that these are inequality constraints not equality constraints.</p>
<p>We saw this scenario before with regularization, where we minimized <span class="math">\(\insample(\weight)\)</span> under a constraint:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\text {minimize:} &amp;\insample(\weight) = \frac 1 N (\mathbf {Zw - y})^\intercal (\mathbf {Zw - y}) \\[5 pt]
&amp;\text {subject to:} \quad \weightT \weight \leq C
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>We <a href="#solution-vectors">found</a> that <span class="math">\(\nabla \insample\)</span> was normal to the constraint. This presents a conceptual dichotomy between regularization and <abbr title="Support Vector Machines">SVM</abbr>. In regularization, we optimize the in-sample error <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> under the constraint <span class="math">\(\weightT \weight\)</span>. Conversely, with <abbr title="Support Vector Machines">SVM</abbr> we are optimizing <span class="math">\(\weightT \weight\)</span> under the constraint that <span class="math">\(\insample = 0\)</span>.</p>

<h2 id="lagrange-formulation">Lagrange Formulation</h2>
<p>To recap, we are performing the following constrained optimization:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\text {minimize }\colon&amp; \frac 1 2 \weightT \weight \\
\text {subject to }\colon&amp; y_n(\weightT \feature_n + b) \geq 1
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>We first take the inequality constraint and put it in zero-form, so that:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\alpha_n (\underbrace {y_n(\weightT \feature_n + b) - 1}_{\text {slack}})\]</span></p>
<p>This is then combined with the optimization component to form the full optimization problem, which is a Lagrangian <span class="math">\(\mathcal L\)</span> dependent on <span class="math">\(\weight\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, and the Lagrange multipliers <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\text {minimize}\colon &amp;\mathcal L(\weight, b, \mathbf \alpha) = \frac 1 2 \weightT \weight - \sum_{n = 1}^N \alpha_n (y_n(\weightT \feature_n + b) - 1) \\
&amp;\text {w.r.t. } \weight \text { and } b, \text { and maximize w.r.t. each } \alpha_n \geq 0
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>Now we can find the gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to the weight, which we want to minimize by setting it to the zero-vector:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\nabla_\weight \mathcal L = \weight - \sum_{n = 1}^N \alpha_n y_n \feature_n = \mathbf 0\]</span></p>
<p>Now we find the derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to <span class="math">\(b\)</span> in order to minimize it by setting it to zero:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\frac {\partial \mathcal L} {\partial b} = - \sum_{n = 1}^N \alpha_n y_n\]</span></p>
<p>We now want to combine these optimization components in order to remove the <span class="math">\(\weight\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> from the optimization problem, so that it’s instead only a function of <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>. This is referred to as the <em>dual formulation</em> of the problem:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\mathcal L(\mathbf \alpha) = &amp;\sum_{n = 1}^N \alpha_n - \frac 1 N \sum_{n = 1}^N \sum_{m = 1}^N y_n y_m \alpha_n \alpha_m \feature_n^\intercal \feature_m \\ \\
&amp;\text {maximize w.r.t. } \mathbf \alpha \\
&amp;\text {subject to } \alpha_n \geq 0 \text { for } n = 1, \dots, N
\text { and } \smash {\sum_{n = 1}^N} \alpha_n y_n = 0
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>We still have to get rid of the constraints in order to have a pure optimization problem that we can pass on to some external <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_programming">quadratic programming</a> library. First of all, most quadratic programming packages perform minimizations not maximizations, so we have to convert it to a minimization, which is accomplished by simply negating the equation:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\max_\alpha \sum_{n = 1}^N \alpha_n - \frac 1 N \sum_{n = 1}^N \sum_{m = 1}^N y_n y_m \alpha_n \alpha_m \feature_n^\intercal \feature_m \\
\min_\alpha \frac 1 N \sum_{n = 1}^N \sum_{m = 1}^N y_n y_m \alpha_n \alpha_m \feature_n^\intercal \feature_m - \sum_{n = 1}^N \alpha_n
\]</span></p>
<p>Next we want to isolate the coefficients from the <span class="math">\(\mathbf \alpha\)</span> values, since the <span class="math">\(\mathbf \alpha\)</span> are parameters. What the quadratic programming library receives are the coefficients of our particular problem <span class="math">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\feature\)</span> and produces the <span class="math">\(\mathbf \alpha\)</span> values that minimize the above equation. This is accomplished <span id="quadratic-coefficients">as follows</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\min_{\mathbf \alpha}\ &amp;\frac 1 2 {\mathbf \alpha}^\intercal
\underbrace {\begin{bmatrix}
y_1 y_1 \feature_1^\intercal \feature_1 &amp; y_1 y_2 \feature_1^\intercal \feature_2 &amp; \dots &amp; y_1 y_N \feature_1^\intercal \feature_N \\
y_2 y_1 \feature_2^\intercal \feature_1 &amp; y_2 y_2 \feature_2^\intercal \feature_2 &amp; \dots &amp; y_2 y_N \feature_2^\intercal \feature_N \\
\dots &amp; \dots &amp; \dots &amp; \dots \\
y_N y_1 \feature_N^\intercal \feature_1 &amp; y_N y_2 \feature_N^\intercal \feature_2 &amp; \dots &amp; y_N y_N \feature_N^\intercal \feature_N \\
\end{bmatrix}}_{\text {quadratic coefficients}}
\mathbf \alpha + \underbrace {(-\mathbf 1^\intercal) \mathbf \alpha}_{\text {linear coefficients}} \\ \\
&amp;\text {subject to}\colon \underbrace {\mathbf y^\intercal \mathbf \alpha = 0}_{\text {linear constraint}}, \quad \underbrace {0 \leq \mathbf \alpha \leq \infty}_{\text {lower and upper bounds}}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The matrix in this equation as well as the linear coefficients are passed to the quadratic programming library. The above equation is equivalent to:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\min_{\mathbf \alpha}\ &amp;\frac 1 2 \mathbf \alpha^\intercal Q \mathbf \alpha - \mathbf 1^\intercal \mathbf \alpha \\ \\
&amp;\text {subject to } \mathbf y^\intercal \mathbf {\alpha} = 0, \quad \mathbf \alpha \geq \mathbf 0
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>It’s important to note the implications of the number of examples, which clearly yields a larger matrix, in which case there are a variety of heuristics that mitigate this problem.</p>
<p>After being fed the quadratic and linear coefficients, the quadratic programming library produces the vector <span class="math">\(\mathbf {\alpha} = \alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_N\)</span>, from which we need to determine the value of <span class="math">\(\weight\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, the margin, and so on. The weights can be computed as based on the previous constraint that concerned it:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\weight = \sum_{n = 1}^N \alpha_n y_n \feature_n\]</span></p>
<p>It might be surprising to realize that the majority of the <span class="math">\(\mathbf \alpha\)</span> vector consists of zero elements (interior points). This is due to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karush%E2%80%93Kuhn%E2%80%93Tucker_conditions">Karush-Kuhn-Tucker</a> (KKT) condition that’s relevant here that says that <em>either</em> the slack is zero or the Lagrange multiplier is zero, such that their product is definitely zero:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\text {For } n = 1, \dots, N \\
\alpha_n(y_n(\weightT \feature_n + b) - 1) = 0
\]</span></p>
<p>We saw this before in <a href="#solution-visualization">regularization</a>, where we had a constraint which was to be within the red circle while optimizing a function represented by the blue circle. When the constraint didn’t really constraint us and the absolute optimal was within the blue circle, there was no need for regularization and so <span class="math">\(\lambda = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>The points which define the plane and margin are the ones for which the <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> values are positive, and all of these values form a <em>support vector</em>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\alpha_n &gt; 0 \Longrightarrow \feature_n \text { is a } \textbf {support vector}\]</span></p>
<p>That is, we had <span class="math">\(N\)</span> points which we classified and for which we found the maximum margin, and the margin touched some of the <span class="math">\(+1\)</span> and some of the <span class="math">\(-1\)</span> points, and it is said that these points “support the plane,” and are called support vectors, while the rest of the points are interior points. In the image below, the support vectors are those points that touch the extents of the margin, those with a circle around them:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/support-vector-machines/support-vectors.png" class="center"></p>
<p>Since most <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> are zero, the weight calculation can be changed to only sum those in the support vector:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\weight = \sum_{n = 1}^N \alpha_n y_n \feature_n = \sum_{\feature_n \text { is SV}} \alpha_n y_n \feature_n\]</span></p>
<p>We can also solve for the bias <span class="math">\(b\)</span> corresponding to threshold term using <strong><em>any</em></strong> support vector, for which we already know that:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[y_n(\weightT \feature_n + b) = 1\]</span></p>
<h2 id="svm-non-linear-transformations">Non-Linear Transformations</h2>
<p>Although all of this so far has only handled situations where the data is linearly separable, it’s possible to attempt to solve it using non-linear transformations in the <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space as we did with perceptrons.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\mathcal L(\mathbf \alpha) = \sum_{n = 1}^N \alpha_n - \frac 1 N \sum_{n = 1}^N \sum_{m = 1}^N y_n y_m \alpha_n \alpha_m \feature_n^\intercal \feature_m \\
\]</span></p>
<p>Observing the equation to maximize, we can see that there are only two components which may need to change in this transition between the <span class="math">\(\mathcal X\)</span>-space and the <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\mathcal L(\mathbf \alpha) = \sum_{n = 1}^N \alpha_n - \frac 1 N \sum_{n = 1}^N \sum_{m = 1}^N y_n y_m \alpha_n \alpha_m \mathbf {z}_n^\intercal \mathbf {z}_m
\]</span></p>
<p>The increase in dimensionality resulting from the non-linear transformation has no effect on the complexity of the optimization. The quadratic optimization process results in the <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> vector, which is interpreted in the original <span class="math">\(\mathcal X\)</span>-space.</p>
<p>During a non-linear transformation, the support vectors resulting from the optimization “live” in <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space. In <span class="math">\(\mathcal X\)</span>-space, these same points can be thought of as “pre-images” of support vectors, those with a circle around them:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/support-vector-machines/x-space-non-linear-svm.png" class="center"></p>
<p>It’s important to remember that the distance between the points in <span class="math">\(\mathcal X\)</span>-space and the resulting curve are <em>not</em> the margin, since the margin is maintained only in <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that even if the non-linear transformation involved a million-dimensional transformation, we ended up with four support vectors, which effectively corresponds to having four parameters, so that generalization applies to the four parameters and not the entire million. This means we’re able to use the flexibility of a higher dimensional representation without sacrificing generalization. In other words, we have a complex hypothesis <span class="math">\(h\)</span>, but a simple hypothesis set <span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span>. Therefore, the generalization result is:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\mathbb E[\outsample] \leq \frac {\mathbb E[\text {# of SVs}]} {N - 1}\]</span></p>
<h1 id="kernel-methods">Kernel Methods</h1>
<p>We want to go to the <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space without paying the price for it. We saw previously that going to the <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space involved a very simple dot product:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\mathcal L(\mathbf \alpha) = \sum_{n = 1}^N \alpha_n - \frac 1 N \sum_{n = 1}^N \sum_{m = 1}^N y_n y_m \alpha_n \alpha_m \mathbf {z}_n^\intercal \mathbf {z}_m
\]</span></p>
<p>We would like to see if we could do away with this relatively low cost altogether. The constraints for this equation are:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\text {constraints: } \alpha_n \geq 0 \text { for } n = 1, \dots, N \text { and } \sum_{n = 1}^N \alpha_n y_n = 0
\]</span></p>
<p>Notice that <span class="math">\(\mathbf z\)</span> isn’t present in the constraints. The hypothesis is essentially:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
g(\feature) &amp;= \sign(\weightT \mathbf z + b) \\
\text {where } \weight &amp;= \sum_{\mathbf z_n \text { is SV}} \alpha_n y_n \mathbf z_n \\
\text {and } b &amp;\colon y_n(\weightT \mathbf z_m + b) = 1
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>We can then substitute the weight’s definition into the hypothesis function, in which case we require the inner products consisting of <span class="math">\(\mathbf z_n^\intercal \mathbf z\)</span>. We can do the same exact thing to determine the value of <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, in which case we need <span class="math">\(\mathbf z_n^\intercal \mathbf z_m\)</span>. In effect, this means that we only deal with <span class="math">\(\mathbf z\)</span> as far as the inner product in the hypothesis function is concerned.</p>
<h2 id="kernel-trick">Kernel Trick</h2>
<h3 id="polynomial-kernel">Polynomial Kernel</h3>
<p>Given two points <span class="math">\(\feature\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\feature&#39; \in \mathcal X\)</span>, we need <span class="math">\(\mathbf z^\intercal \mathbf z&#39;\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\(\mathbf z^\intercal \mathbf z&#39; = K(\feature, \feature&#39;)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(K\)</span> is referred to as the <em>kernel</em>, which corresponds to some <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space, it is considered the “inner product” of <span class="math">\(\feature\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\feature&#39;\)</span> after some transormation. For example <span class="math">\(\feature = (x_1, x_2)\)</span> undergoes a 2nd-order non-linear transformation:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\mathbf z = \Phi(\feature) = (1, x_1, x_2, x_1^2, x_2^2, x_1 x_2)\]</span></p>
<p>So the kernel would be defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
K(\feature, \feature&#39;) = \mathbf {z^\intercal z&#39;} =
1 + x_1 {x&#39;}_1 + x_2 {x&#39;}_2 + x_1^2 {x&#39;}_1^2 + x_2^2 {x&#39;}_2^2 + x_1 {x&#39;}_1 x_2 {x&#39;}_2
\]</span></p>
<p>Now the question is whether or not we can transform the kernel <span class="math">\(K(\feature, \feature&#39;)\)</span> <strong>without</strong> transforming <span class="math">\(\feature\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\feature&#39;\)</span> into the <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space. Consider the following:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
K(\feature, \feature&#39;) &amp;= (1 + \feature^\intercal \feature&#39;)^2 = (1 + x_1 {x&#39;}_1 + x_2 {x&#39;}_2)^2 \\
&amp;= 1 + x_1^2 {x&#39;}_1^2 + x_2^2 {x&#39;}_2^2 + 2 x_1 {x&#39;}_1 + 2 x_2 {x&#39;}_2 + 2 x_1 {x&#39;}_1 x_2 {x&#39;}_2
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>This looks very similar to an inner product if it weren’t for the twos, in which case it’d be as if we transformed to the 2nd-order polynomial and took the inner product there. However, this <em>is</em> an inner product if we say that the transformation that we are using is:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\Phi(\feature) &amp;= (1, x_1^2, x_2^2, \sqrt {2 x_1}, \sqrt {2 x_2}, \sqrt 2 x_1 x_2) \\
\Phi(\feature&#39;) &amp;= (1, {x&#39;}_1^2, {x&#39;}_2^2, \sqrt {2 {x&#39;}_1}, \sqrt {2 {x&#39;}_2}, \sqrt 2 {x&#39;}_1 {x&#39;}_2)
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The advantage of the kernel is that we don’t have to take each feature and expand it per the non-linear transformation in order to perform the inner product, instead we directly compute the inner product from the <span class="math">\(\mathcal X\)</span>-space feature vector.</p>
<p>More specifically, this is called the <em>polynomial kernel</em>. Generally, given a general d-dimensional space <span class="math">\(\mathcal X = \mathbb R^d\)</span> with a transformation of that space into a Qth-order polynomial <span class="math">\(\Phi\colon \mathcal {X \to Z}\)</span>, the “equivalent” kernel would be:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
K(\feature, \feature&#39;) &amp;= (1 + \feature^\intercal \feature&#39;)^Q \\
&amp;= (1 + x_1 {x&#39;}_1 + x_2 {x&#39;}_2 + \cdots + x_d {x&#39;}_d)^Q \\
&amp;= (a \feature^\intercal \feature&#39; + b)^Q
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>A kernel of the above form corresponds to an inner product in a higher space. So now all we have to do is use the <span class="math">\(\mathcal X\)</span>-space feature vectors, compute the dot product, and raise that value to some exponent, instead of having to explicitly go into the <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space. This is all guaranteed if the kernel <span class="math">\(K(\feature, \feature&#39;)\)</span> is an inner product in <em>some</em> space <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space. Consider the following kernel:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[K(\feature, \feature&#39;) = \exp\left(-\gamma\ \lVert \feature - \feature&#39; \rVert^2\right)\]</span></p>
<p>This kernel is clearly a function of <span class="math">\(\feature\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\feature&#39;\)</span>. It doesn’t have a clear inner product. Does this correspond to an inner product in <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space? Indeed it is, if the <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space is treated as being <em>infinite-dimensional</em>. In this case we would get the full benefit of a non-linear transformation, without worrying about the generalization ramifications of going to an infinite-dimensional space. For example, take a simple case where the kernel is applied to a one-dimensional <span class="math">\(\mathcal X\)</span>-space and <span class="math">\(\gamma = 1\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
K(x, x&#39;) &amp;= \exp\left(-(x - x&#39;)^2\right) \\
&amp;= \exp(-x^2) \exp(-{x&#39;}^2) \exp(2 x x&#39;) \\
&amp;= \exp(-x^2) \exp(-{x&#39;}^2) \underbrace {\sum_{k = 0}^\infty \frac {2^k (x)^k (x&#39;)^k} {k!}}_{\text {Taylor Series}} \\
\end{align}

<p>The <span class="math">\(x\)</span> terms can be grouped together and so can the <span class="math">\(x&#39;\)</span> terms, and ultimately this equation can be transformed to look like an inner product in an infinite space, due to the infinite summation. This kernel is called the <em>radial basis function</em> (<abbr title="Radial Basis Function">RBF</abbr>) kernel.</p>
<p>To see it in action, in the case of a slightly non-separable case in the <span class="math">\(\mathcal X\)</span>-space with a slightly curvy target function. We transform this dataset into an <span class="math">\(\infty\)</span>-dimensional <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space. The red and blue points are the support vectors (9 total; 4 blue, 5 red), the lime curve is the target function and the black curve is the <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space hyperplane:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/kernel-methods/radial-basis-function-example.png" class="center"></p>
<p>Here we were able to visit an infinite-dimensional space and yield only 9 support vectors, which thanks to the error bound we developed earlier means that the out-of-sample error must be less than about <span class="math">\(10\%\)</span>. Previously, going to an infinite or even higher order <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space was considered overkill, but that determination is now made based on the number of resultant support vectors.</p>
<p>An important thing to remember is that the distances between the support vectors and the <span class="math">\(\mathcal X\)</span>-space hyperplane will possibly not be minimal, because that distance that was solved for was solved in <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space not <span class="math">\(\mathcal X\)</span>-space. The support vectors are not support vectors per se, but rather they are “pre-images” of the actual support vectors in the <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space.</p>
<h3 id="kernel-formulation-of-svm">Kernel Formulation of SVM</h3>
<p>In solving support vector machines, we would <a href="#quadratic-coefficients">pass the inner products</a> of the feature vectors to the quadratic programming library. All that changes now is that we instead pass the result of the kernel function <span class="math">\(K\)</span>; <strong>everything else remains the same</strong>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\underbrace {\begin{bmatrix}
y_1 y_1 K(\feature_1, \feature_1) &amp; y_1 y_2 K(\feature_1, \feature_2) &amp; \dots &amp; y_1 y_N K(\feature_1, \feature_N) \\
y_2 y_1 K(\feature_2, \feature_1) &amp; y_2 y_2 K(\feature_2, \feature_2) &amp; \dots &amp; y_2 y_N K(\feature_2, \feature_N) \\
\dots &amp; \dots &amp; \dots &amp; \dots \\

<p>When we receive the <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> and we need to construct the hypothesis in terms of the kernel. In other words, we want to express <span class="math">\(g(\feature) = \sign(\weightT \mathbf z + b)\)</span> in terms of <span class="math">\(K(-, -)\)</span>. First remember the definition of the weight:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\weight = \sum_{\mathbf z_n \text { is SV}} \alpha_n y_n \mathbf z_n
\]</span></p>
<p>So now we can construct the hypothesis, which is also the general <abbr title="Support Vector Machines">SVM</abbr> model, which differs based on the kernel function:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
g(\feature) &amp;= \sign\left( \sum_{\alpha_n &gt; 0} \alpha_n y_n K(\feature_n, \feature) + b \right) \\
\text {where } b &amp;= y_m - \sum_{\alpha_n &gt; 0} \alpha_n y_n K(\feature_n, \feature_m)
\end{align}

<h3 id="kernel-function-validity">Kernel Function Validity</h3>
<p>How can we determine that a kernel is valid, i.e. that it corresponds to an inner product in <em>some</em> space, <em>without</em> visiting that space? In other words, how do we know that <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span> exists for a given <span class="math">\(K(\feature, \feature&#39;)\)</span>?</p>
<p>There are three approaches to come up with a valid kernel. The first method is by construction. The second is by using mathematical properties of the kernel (i.e. Mercer’s condition), which have already been applied to kernel functions other people have developed which can be applied to our own problems. The third approach is to simply not care whether or not <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span> exists, which is an approach taken by a number of people but for which Professor Yaser Abu-Mostafa has reservations, since the guarantees of the method depend on <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span> existing.</p>
<p>To take the second approach for the purposes of designing our own kernel. A kernel <span class="math">\(K(\feature, \feature&#39;)\)</span> is a valid kernel iff:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is symmetric so that <span class="math">\(K(\feature, \feature&#39;) = K(\feature&#39;, \feature)\)</span></li>
<li>The matrix of all possible pairs of feature vectors applied to the kernel function is <em>positive semi-definite</em>, that is, the matrix should be greater than or equal to 0, for any <span class="math">\(\feature_1, \dots, \feature_N\)</span>. This is known as <em>Mercer’s condition</em>:</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math">\[

<h2 id="soft-margin-svm">Soft-Margin SVM</h2>
<p>There are two main kinds of non-separable situations. Slightly non-separable (left) is when it might be beneficial to simply accept that as error using something like the pocket algorithm, as opposed to sacrificing generalization in order to capture what are potentially simply outliers. Seriously non-separable (right) is when it’s not a matter of outliers, but that the data is simply non-linearly separable.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px">
<img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/kernel-methods/slightly-non-separable.png"> <img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/kernel-methods/seriously-non-separable.png">
</div>
<p>Slightly-separable data can be handled by soft-margin <abbr title="Support Vector Machines">SVM</abbr>, while seriously non-separable data can be handled by kernel functions. In real world data sets, however, it’s likely that there will be elements of both: built-in non-linearity with outliers. For this reason, we would be combining kernels with soft-margin <abbr title="Support Vector Machines">SVM</abbr>s in almost all of the problems that we would encounter.</p>
<h3 id="soft-margin-svm-error-measure">Error Measure</h3>
<p>The error measure will be defined by a so-called margin violation, which could be the point within the margin in the image below. Even though it is correctly classified by the hyperplane, it’s considered a <em>margin violation</em> because it falls within the margin.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/kernel-methods/margin-violation.png" class="center"></p>
<p>It can be said that the margin is violated when <span class="math">\(y_n(\weightT \feature_n + b) \geq 1\)</span> fails. This failure can be quantified by introducing a “slack” <span class="math">\(\xi_n \geq 0\)</span> for every point so that:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[y_n(\weightT \feature_n + b) \geq 1 - \xi_n\]</span></p>
<p>The total violation made by a derived <abbr title="Support Vector Machines">SVM</abbr> can be expressed as the sum of the slacks, since those that don’t violate the margin will have <span class="math">\(\xi = 0\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\text {Total violation } = \sum_{n = 1}^N \xi_n\]</span></p>
<h3 id="soft-margin-svm-optimization">Optimization</h3>
<p>The previous optimization that we performed was to minimize the following quantity, which had the effect of maximizing the margin:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\frac 1 2 \weightT \weight\]</span></p>
<p>Now we are going to add an error term that corresponds to the violation of the margin:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\text {minimize } &amp;\frac 1 2 \weightT \weight + C \sum_{n = 1}^N \xi_n \\
\text {subject to } &amp;y_n(\weightT \feature_n + b) \geq 1 - \xi_n \quad \text { for } n = 1, \dots, N \\ \\
&amp;\text {and } \xi_n \geq 0 \quad \text { for } n = 1, \dots, N \\
&amp;\weight \in \mathbb R^d, b \in \mathbb R, \xi \in \mathbb R^N
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>In this new optimization problem, <span class="math">\(C\)</span> is a constant that represents the relative importance of the error versus the margin, similar to augmented error. For example, a very high value of <span class="math">\(C\)</span> represents that error cannot be afforded, whereas a very low value of <span class="math">\(C\)</span> means that we can have a large margin but it would have a higher rate of errors.</p>
<p>The Lagrange formulation for this optimization problem can thus be derived as follows, where the first equation is the original Lagrange formulation:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\mathcal L(\weight, b, \phantom {\xi}, \alpha, \phantom {\beta}) &amp;= \frac 1 2 \weightT \weight \phantom {+ C \sum_{n = 1}^N \xi_n}
- \sum_{n = 1}^N \alpha_n(y_n(\weightT \feature_n + b) - 1 \phantom {+ \xi_n})
\phantom {- \sum_{n = 1}^N \beta_n \xi_n} \\ \\
\mathcal L(\weight, b, \xi, \alpha, \beta) &amp;= \frac 1 2 \weightT \weight + C \sum_{n = 1}^N \xi_n
- \sum_{n = 1}^N \alpha_n(y_n(\weightT \feature_n + b) - 1 + \xi_n)
- \sum_{n = 1}^N \beta_n \xi_n \\ \\
&amp;\text {minimize w.r.t. } \weight, b, \text { and } \xi \\
&amp;\text {maximize w.r.t. each } \alpha_n \geq 0 \text { and } \beta_n \geq 0
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The minimization with respect to <span class="math">\(\weight\)</span> is the same as before:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\nabla_\weight \mathcal L = \weight - \sum_{n = 1}^N \alpha_n y_n \feature_n = \mathbf 0\]</span></p>
<p>The minimization with respect to <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is also the same as before:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\frac {\partial \mathcal L} {\partial b} = - \sum_{n = 1}^N \alpha_n y_n = 0\]</span></p>
<p>The minimization with respect to <span class="math">\(\xi\)</span> can be derived as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\frac {\partial \mathcal L} {\partial \xi_n} = C - \alpha_n - \beta_n = 0\]</span></p>
<p>The ramifications of the final equation is that the Lagrange formulation above reduces back down to the original Lagrange formulation, with the only added constraint that <span class="math">\(\alpha_n\)</span> be <strong>at most</strong> <span class="math">\(C\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\text {Maximize } &amp;\mathcal L(\mathbf \alpha) = \sum_{n = 1}^N \alpha_n - \frac 1 N \sum_{n = 1}^N \sum_{m = 1}^N y_n y_m \alpha_n \alpha_m \feature_n^\intercal \feature_m \quad \text {w.r.t } \alpha \\
\text {Subject to } &amp;0 \leq \alpha_n \leq C\ \text { for } n = 1, \dots, N\ \text { and } \sum_{n = 1}^N \alpha_n y_n = 0
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>The result of this minimization is the weight:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\weight = \sum_{n = 1}^N \alpha_n y_n \feature_n\]</span></p>
<p>This particular weight guarantees that we are minimizing the quantity:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\frac 1 2 \weightT \weight + C \sum_{n = 1}^N \xi_n\]</span></p>
<p>In practical terms, well we have to do to use a soft-margin is to ensure that <span class="math">\(0 \leq \alpha_n \leq C\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-support-vectors">Types of Support Vectors</h3>
<p>We call the support vectors that fall on the hyperplane boundary <em>margin support vectors</em> (<span class="math">\(0 \lt \alpha_n \lt C\)</span>):</p>
<p><span class="math">\[y_n(\weightT \feature_n + b) = 1 \quad (\xi_n = 0)\]</span></p>
<p>The other vectors that don’t fall on the hyperplane boundary but are still correctly classified are referred to as <em>non-margin support vectors</em> (<span class="math">\(\alpha_n = C\)</span>):</p>
<p><span class="math">\[y_n(\weightT \feature_n + b) \lt 1 \quad (\xi_n \gt 0)\]</span></p>
<p>The <span class="math">\(C\)</span> parameter is determined in practice using <a href="#cross-validation">cross-validation</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/kernel-methods/types-of-support-vectors.png" class="center"></p>
<p>There are two final observations.</p>
<p>First, with the hard margin, what happens if the data is not linearly separable? The translation from the “primal” form (minimizing <span class="math">\(\weightT \weight\)</span>) to the “dual” form (maximizing <span class="math">\(\mathcal L(\alpha)\)</span>) begins to break down. This is mathematically valid only if there is a feasible solution. The point is that we don’t have to worry about this, we don’t have to go through the combinatorial process of determining whether a data set is linearly separable. Instead, we can validate the solution.</p>
<p>Second, when we transform to the <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space, some of these transformations had a constant coordinate of <span class="math">\(1\)</span>. This used to correspond to <span class="math">\(w_0\)</span>, but we made a point to state that in support vectors there are no <span class="math">\(w_0\)</span> values, since we took them out as a separate variable <span class="math">\(b\)</span>. If the <span class="math">\(\mathcal Z\)</span>-space transformation has a <span class="math">\(w_0 = 1\)</span>, then we effectively have two variables doing the same thing. We don’t have to worry about this either though because when we get the solution, all of the corresponding weights will go to <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, and the bulk of the bias will go to <span class="math">\(b\)</span>.</p>
<h1 id="radial-basis-functions">Radial Basis Functions</h1>
<p>Radial basis functions serve as the glue between many different machine learning topics. The idea is that every point in the data set <span class="math">\((\feature_n, y_n) \in \mathcal D\)</span> influences the value of the hypothesis <span class="math">\(h(\feature)\)</span> at every point <span class="math">\(\feature\)</span> based on the distance to nearby points <span class="math">\(\lVert \feature - \feature_n \rVert\)</span>. For example, imagine in the bottom image that the top of the bump is <span class="math">\(\feature_n\)</span> and the surface represents the influence to other points, and the symmetry of the function shows that this influence is a function of the distance.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/radial-basis-functions/rbf-example.png" class="center"></p>
<p>The standard form of of a radial basis function embeds the notion that the closer a point is to the feature point, the more of an influence it has on it:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[h(\feature) = \sum_{n = 1}^N w_n \underbrace {\exp\left( -\gamma\ \lVert \feature - \feature_n \rVert^2 \right)}_{\text {basis function}}\]</span></p>
<p>The equation shows the source of the <em>basis function</em> part of the name, while the <em>radial</em> part of the name comes from the <span class="math">\(\lVert \feature - \feature_n \rVert\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now that we have the model, we can move on to the learning algorithm, where we want to find the parameters <span class="math">\(w_1, \dots, w_n\)</span>. First it’s useful to note that we have <span class="math">\(N\)</span> parameters <span class="math">\(w_n\)</span>, so it shouldn’t be difficult to find parameters such that <span class="math">\(\insample = 0\)</span>, so that <span class="math">\(h(\feature_n) = y_n\)</span> for <span class="math">\(n = 1, \dots, N\)</span>. This constraint can be expressed as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\sum_{m = 1}^N w_m \exp\left( -\gamma\ \lVert \feature_n - \feature_m \rVert^2 \right) = y_n\]</span></p>
<p>This shows that there are <span class="math">\(N\)</span> equations, one for each data point with <span class="math">\(N\)</span> unknown <span class="math">\(w\)</span> parameters.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\newcommand{\basis}[2]{\exp \left(-\gamma\ \lVert #1 - #2 \rVert^2 \right)}
\underbrace {\begin{bmatrix}
\basis {\feature_1} {\feature_1} &amp; \dots &amp; \basis {\feature_1} {\feature_N} \\
\basis {\feature_2} {\feature_1} &amp; \dots &amp; \basis {\feature_2} {\feature_N} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
\basis {\feature_N} {\feature_1} &amp; \dots &amp; \basis {\feature_N} {\feature_N} \\

y_1 \vphantom {\Big(} \\
y_2 \vphantom {\Big(} \\
\vdots \\
y_N \vphantom {\Big(}
\end{bmatrix}}_{\mathbf y}
\]</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math">\(\mathbf \Phi\)</span> is invertible, then the solution is simply:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\weight = \mathbf \Phi^{-1} \mathbf y \quad \text {if } \mathbf \Phi \text { is invertible}\]</span></p>
<p>This solution can be interpreted as being an <em>exact interpolation</em>, because on the points for which we know the value of the hypothesis, we’re getting the exact output <span class="math">\(y\)</span> value.</p>
<h2 id="effect-of-gamma">Effect of <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span></h2>
<p>The effect of <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> is such that if it is small, the Gaussian is a wider curve, whereas if it were larger it’d be a steeper curve. Depending on where the points are—specifically how sparse they are—the steepness of the curve makes a difference.</p>
<p>The image on the left shows the effect of choosing a small <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span>. The three training points are on the curve, since that was what the constraint was. The smaller gray curves are the individual contributions from each of the points, that is, <span class="math">\(w_1, w_2, w_3\)</span>, such that when they’re plugged into the hypothesis function it yields the blue curve.</p>
<p>The image on the right shows the effect of choosing a larger <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span>. The interpolation between any two points is poor because the individual contributions of each point “dies out” too quickly.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px">
<img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/radial-basis-functions/small-gamma.png"> <img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/radial-basis-functions/large-gamma.png">
</div>
<p>It’s apparent that <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> has an effect on the performance of interpolation, and that it seems to depend on the data set in question, specifically, how far apart the points are. We will cover the choice of <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> later on.</p>
<h2 id="rbf-classification">Classification</h2>
<p>The model described above was a regression model, where we considered the output to be real-valued which was matched with the target output which was also real-valued. It’s possible to use <abbr title="Radial Basis Function">RBF</abbr>s for classification, however, by modifying the hypothesis function to be:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[h(\feature) = \sign\left(\sum_{n = 1}^N w_n \exp\left( -\gamma\ \lVert \feature - \feature_n \rVert^2 \right)\right)\]</span></p>
<p>The question now is how to determine the <span class="math">\(w_n\)</span> values with this <span class="math">\(\sign\)</span> function now involved. We’ve done this before when we applied <a href="#linear-regression-for-classification">linear regression for classification</a>. We will focus on the inner component of the <span class="math">\(\sign\)</span> function, the signal <span class="math">\(s\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[s = \sum_{n = 1}^N w_n \exp\left( -\gamma\ \lVert \feature - \feature_n \rVert^2 \right)\]</span></p>
<p>Where we will try to make the signal itself match the <span class="math">\(\pm 1\)</span> target. So that we can minimize <span class="math">\((s - y)^2\)</span> on <span class="math">\(\mathcal D\)</span> knowing that <span class="math">\(y = \pm 1\)</span>, then we simply return <span class="math">\(h(\feature) = \sign(s)\)</span>.</p>
<p><abbr title="Radial Basis Function">RBF</abbr>s share a relationship to the nearest-neighbor method, where we classify by looking at the closest point <span class="math">\(\feature_n\)</span> within the training set to the point <span class="math">\(\feature\)</span> being considered, so that <span class="math">\(\feature\)</span> inherits the label <span class="math">\(y_n\)</span> corresponding to that closest point <span class="math">\(\feature_n\)</span>. For example in the image below, all points in a given red-shaded region inherit the label of the red point within that region because all points within that region are closest to that point rather than any of the other points that define other different regions:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/radial-basis-functions/nearest-neighbors.png" class="center"></p>
<p>This can be approximated with <abbr title="Radial Basis Function">RBF</abbr>s, where we only take influence of nearby points. The basis function would look like a cylinder as in the image below, where it’s a given constant value or zero. With this basis function, the regions would look more like the cylinders.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/radial-basis-functions/nearest-neighbors-basis-function.png" class="center"></p>
<p>The nearest-neighbor approach is pretty brittle, as the boundaries between the regions are abrupt. It can be modified into the <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-nearest neighbors, where instead of taking the value of the closest point, we look at the <span class="math">\(k\)</span> nearest points and adopt the label most represented by those points. This has an effect of smoothing the surface, where the number of fluctuations will decrease.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Radial Basis Function">RBF</abbr> can be smoothed similarly by using a Gaussian instead of a cylinder, which does a good job of representing a gradual decrease in influence.</p>
<p>In both cases, the model can be considered as a <em>similarity-based method</em>, where we are classifying points according to how similar they are to points in the training set.</p>
<h3 id="k-centers-rbf">K-Centers RBF</h3>
<p>We are generally mindful of generalization as a ratio between the number of parameters and data points. However, the <abbr title="Radial Basis Function">RBF</abbr> model we described has <span class="math">\(N\)</span> parameters <span class="math">\(w_1, \dots, w_N\)</span> based on <span class="math">\(N\)</span> data points, so it may seem hopeless to generalize. We can mitigate this by preventing every point from having its own influence, and instead appoint a number <span class="math">\(K\)</span> of important centers for the data and have them influence the points around them.</p>
<p>We do this by taking <span class="math">\(K \ll N\)</span> centers <span class="math">\(\mathbf {\mu_1, \dots, \mu_K}\)</span> as the centers of the <abbr title="Radial Basis Function">RBF</abbr>s instead of <span class="math">\(\feature_1, \dots, \feature_N\)</span>. The <span class="math">\(K\)</span> centers live in the same space as <span class="math">\(\feature\)</span>, but they are not necessarily data points—they could be elected data points from the data set, or they may be specially constructed points that we may deem representative of the data set. We then define the hypothesis function as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[h(\feature) = \sum_{k = 1}^K w_k \exp\left(-\gamma\ \lVert \feature - \mu_k \rVert^2\right)\]</span></p>
<p>This hypothesis function now reflects the fact that every point <span class="math">\(\feature_n\)</span> is being compared against every center <span class="math">\(\mathbf \mu_k\)</span>. We now have to determine how to choose the centers <span class="math">\(\mathbf \mu_k\)</span> and the weights <span class="math">\(w_k\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="k-center-rbf-center-selection">K-Means Clustering</h3>
<p>To choose the <span class="math">\(K\)</span> centers, we are going to choose the centers as representative of the data inputs, that is, a representative center will exist for every cluster of data points. Such representative centers would be achieved by minimizing the distance between <span class="math">\(\feature_n\)</span> and the <strong>closest</strong> center <span class="math">\(\mathbf \mu_k\)</span>. This is called <em>K-means clustering</em> because the center of a cluster will end up being the mean of the points in that cluster.</p>
<p>We begin by splitting the data set <span class="math">\(\feature_1, \dots, \feature_N\)</span> into clusters <span class="math">\(S_1, \dots, S_K\)</span>. Again, a good representative center <span class="math">\(\mathbf \mu_k\)</span> of a cluster <span class="math">\(S_k\)</span> would minimize the distance between the points in the cluster and itself, represented as the sum of the Euclidean <abbr title="Mean-Squared Error">MSE</abbr> between the candidate center and each of the points in the cluster. The optimal cluster configuration is achieved by then minimizing the sum of each cluster’s error measure.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\text {Minimize } \quad \sum_{k = 1}^K \sum_{\feature_n \in S_k} \lVert \feature_n - \mathbf \mu_k \rVert^2\]</span></p>
<p>This is <em>unsupervised learning</em>, since it was performed without any reference to the label <span class="math">\(y_n\)</span>. The problem is that this is <em>NP-hard</em> in general; it is intractable to get the absolute minimum. The problem being NP-hard didn’t discourage us before when we realized that finding the absolute minimum error in a neural network was NP-hard as well, in which case we developed a heuristic—gradient descent—which led to back-propagation and thus a decent local-minimum.</p>
<h3 id="lloyds-algorithm">LLoyd’s Algorithm</h3>
<p>We can develop an iterative algorithm to to solve K-means clustering, which works by fixing one of the parameters and attempting to minimize the other. First it fixes the particular membership of the clusters <span class="math">\(\feature_n \in S_k\)</span> and it tries to find the optimal centers. After finding these centers, it then fixes these centers and tries to find the optimal clustering for these centers. This is repeated until convergence:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\begin{align}
\text {Iteratively Minimize } \quad &amp;\sum_{k = 1}^K \sum_{\feature_n \in S_k}
\lVert \feature_n - \mathbf \mu_k \rVert^2 \quad \text {w.r.t. } \mathbf \mu_k, S_k \\ \\
&amp;\mathbf \mu_k \gets \frac 1 {|S_k|} \sum_{\feature_n \in S_k} \feature_n \\
&amp;S_k \gets \{\feature_n : \lVert \feature_n - \mathbf \mu_k \rVert \leq \text { all } \lVert \feature_n - \mathbf \mu_l \rVert\}
\end{align}
\]</span></p>
<p>When updating <span class="math">\(\mathbf \mu_k\)</span>, we essentially take the mean of the points in the cluster: add them up and divide by the amount of points in the cluster. This would be a good representative if <span class="math">\(S_k\)</span> were the real cluster.</p>
<p>The <span class="math">\(\mathbf \mu_k\)</span> value is then frozen and we cluster the points based on it. For every point <span class="math">\(\feature_n\)</span> in the data set, we measure the distance to the new center and admit it to the cluster <span class="math">\(S_k\)</span> if this distance is smaller than the distance between this point <span class="math">\(\feature_n\)</span> and any of the other clusters <span class="math">\(\mathbf \mu_l\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is apparent that both steps are minimizing the original quantity, and since there are only a finite number of points and a finite number of possible values for <span class="math">\(\mathbf \mu_k\)</span>, it is <strong>guaranteed</strong> that we will converge, albeit to a local minimum, which is sensitive to the initial centers or clusters, just like neural networks converged to a local minimum dependent on the initial weights. The general way of choosing decent initial centers or clusters is to perform a number of runs with different centers or clusters and choosing the best one.</p>
<p>LLoyd’s algorithm can be visualized in the image below. The algorithm is fed the only the inputs of the data set, with the centers initialized so some pre-defined values (black dots), then the algorithm iterates and outputs the representative <span class="math">\(\mathbf \mu_k\)</span> centers.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/radial-basis-functions/lloyds-algorithm.png" class="center"></p>
<p>Notice that since we cluster values without looking at the label <span class="math">\(y_n\)</span>, we can have clusters that lie on the boundary so that half of the points are <span class="math">\(+1\)</span> and the other half are <span class="math">\(-1\)</span>. This is the price paid by unsupervised learning, where we want to find similarity as far as the <strong><em>input</em></strong> is concerned, not as far as the behavior with the target function is concerned:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/radial-basis-functions/rbf-centers.png" class="center"></p>
<h3 id="rbf-centers-calculating-weights">Calculating Weights</h3>
<p>Now that we have determined the centers we can determine the weights. Again the hypothesis function was defined as:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\sum_{k = 1}^K w_k \exp\left( -\gamma\ \lVert \feature_n - \mathbf \mu_n \rVert^2 \right) \approx y_n\]</span></p>
<p>In this case there are now <span class="math">\(N\)</span> equations but only <span class="math">\(K &lt; N\)</span> unknowns.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\def \center {\mathbf \mu}
\underbrace {\begin{bmatrix}
\basis {\feature_1} {\center_1} &amp; \dots &amp; \basis {\feature_1} {\center_K} \\
\basis {\feature_2} {\center_1} &amp; \dots &amp; \basis {\feature_2} {\center_K} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
\basis {\feature_N} {\center_1} &amp; \dots &amp; \basis {\feature_N} {\center_K} \\
\end{bmatrix}}_{\mathbf \Phi}
\underbrace {\begin{bmatrix}
w_1 \vphantom {\Big(} \\
w_2 \vphantom {\Big(} \\
\vdots \\
w_K \vphantom {\Big(}
\end{bmatrix}}_{\weight} =
\underbrace {\begin{bmatrix}
y_1 \vphantom {\Big(} \\
y_2 \vphantom {\Big(} \\
\vdots \\
y_N \vphantom {\Big(}
\end{bmatrix}}_{\mathbf y}
\]</span></p>
<p>The weights can be solved for in the same manner as in linear regression by calculating the pseudo-inverse. If <span class="math">\(\mathbf {\Phi^\intercal \Phi}\)</span> is invertible, then:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\weight = \left(\mathbf {\Phi^\intercal \Phi}\right)^{-1} \mathbf {\Phi^\intercal y} \quad \text {if } \mathbf {\Phi^\intercal \Phi} \text { is invertible }\]</span></p>
<p>In this case we aren’t guaranteed to get the correct value at every data point, but we do have a much higher chance at generalization since we only have <span class="math">\(K \ll N\)</span> parameters.</p>
<h2 id="rbf-network">RBF Network</h2>
<p>We can take the <abbr title="Radial Basis Function">RBF</abbr> model and design a graphical network in order to relate it to neural networks. In this graphical network, we take the input and compute the radial component, the distance to every <span class="math">\(\center_k\)</span>. These radial components are handed to a non-linearity <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span>, usually the Gaussian non-linearity. The resultant features are combined with weights <span class="math">\(w_k\)</span> in order to compute the output <span class="math">\(h(\feature)\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/radial-basis-functions/rbf-network.png" class="center"></p>
<p>In this case the “features” are <span class="math">\(\smash {\basis {\feature} {\center_k}}\)</span>. The non-linear transform features depend on <span class="math">\(\mathcal D\)</span>, so it is no longer a linear model. However, since we only used the inputs in order to compute <span class="math">\(\center\)</span> it’s <em>almost</em> linear, since we didn’t have to back-propagate because we didn’t like the output, since the inputs were frozen. This is why the <span class="math">\(w\)</span> values look like multiplicative values, in which case it’s linear on those values.</p>
<p>A bias term (<span class="math">\(b\)</span> or <span class="math">\(w_0\)</span>) is often added at the final layer.</p>
<h3 id="rbf-neural-network-comparison">Neural Network Comparison</h3>
<p>A two-layer neural network can be compared to an <abbr title="Radial Basis Function">RBF</abbr> network.</p>
<p>Both networks compute features, however in the case of <abbr title="Radial Basis Function">RBF</abbr> networks, the features depend on the distance to the center, and if that distance is very large then the influence disappears. That is, if a particular value input is huge, we can know that the corresponding feature will have zero contribution. In the case of a neural network, the input always goes through a sigmoid regardless of its size, meaning that it always has a contribution. What <abbr title="Radial Basis Function">RBF</abbr>s do can be interpreted as looking at local regions of the space without worrying about distant points, such that the basis function will not interfere with those distant points.</p>
<p>The non-linearity is called <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> in <abbr title="Radial Basis Function">RBF</abbr> networks and <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> in neural networks. In neural networks, the input to the non-linearity consisted of the weights <span class="math">\(\weight\)</span> that depended on the labels of the data, so that the error was back-propagated through the network to adjust the weights. This is why in the neural networks the non-linearity outputs are learned features, which definitely makes it a non-linear model. In the case of <abbr title="Radial Basis Function">RBF</abbr> networks, the <span class="math">\(\center\)</span> values are already frozen, so that the <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> is almost linear, which is why we were able to derive the features using the pseudo-inverse.</p>
<p>Any two-layer network with a structure similar to an <abbr title="Radial Basis Function">RBF</abbr> network lends itself to being a support vector machine, where the first layer handles the kernel and the second one is the linear combination that is built into <abbr title="Support Vector Machines">SVM</abbr>s. For example, neural networks can be implemented using <abbr title="Support Vector Machines">SVM</abbr>s with a neural network kernel.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/radial-basis-functions/neural-network.png" class="center"></p>
<h2 id="choosing-gamma">Choosing <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span></h2>
<p>The final parameter to choose was the width of the Gaussian curve <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span>. This is now treated as a genuine parameter to be learned using an iterative approach using an algorithm known as the <em>Expectation Maximization</em> (<abbr title="Expectation Maximization">EM</abbr>) algorithm, which is used for solving the mixture of Gaussians. The algorithm is as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Fix <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span>, solve for <span class="math">\(w_1, \dots, w_K\)</span> (using the pseudo-inverse)</li>
<li>Fix <span class="math">\(w_1, \dots, w_K\)</span>, minimize error w.r.t. <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> (using gradient descent)</li>
</ol>
<p>With this simple algorithm, we can have different <span class="math">\(\gamma_k\)</span> for each center <span class="math">\(\center_k\)</span>, so that for example one center can “reach out further” than another if it has to.</p>
<h2 id="rbf-vs.svm-kernel">RBF vs. SVM Kernel</h2>
<p>We previously saw the <abbr title="Radial Basis Function">RBF</abbr> kernel for <abbr title="Support Vector Machines">SVM</abbr> that implements the following classifier:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\sign\left(\sum_{\alpha_n \gt 0} \alpha_n y_n \basis {\feature} {\feature_n} + b\right)\]</span></p>
<p>We also just saw the straight <abbr title="Radial Basis Function">RBF</abbr> classifier implementation:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\sign\left(\sum_{k = 1}^K w_k \basis {\feature} {\center_k} + b\right)\]</span></p>
<p>The performance of both models can be observed in the image below. It’s apparent from the straight <abbr title="Radial Basis Function">RBF</abbr> implementation that <span class="math">\(\insample \ne 0\)</span> since some points are misclassified. The <abbr title="Support Vector Machines">SVM</abbr> implementation clearly tracks the target better, with <span class="math">\(\insample = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/radial-basis-functions/rbf-vs-svm.png" class="center"></p>
<h2 id="rbf-regularization">Regularization</h2>
<p><abbr title="Radial Basis Function">RBF</abbr>s can be derived based purely on regularization. Take a 1D function with many data points and we want to inter/extra-polate between the points in order to get the whole function. With regularization there are usually two terms: one two minimize <span class="math">\(\insample\)</span> and the regularization term.</p>
<p>The in-sample error minimization term can be defined the squared difference between the hypothesis value and the target value:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\sum_{n = 1}^N (h(x_n) - y_n)^2\]</span></p>
<p>A “smoothness” constraint can be added, which is a constraint on the derivatives, by taking the kth-derivative of the hypothesis and squaring it, since we are only interested in the magnitude of it, and integrate it from <span class="math">\(-\infty\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\infty\)</span>. This would be an estimate of the size of the kth-derivative, where if it’s big then it’s bad for smoothness and vice versa. We can then combine the contributions of different derivatives:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\sum_{k = 0}^\infty a_k \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left( \frac {d^k h} {dx^k} \right)^2 dx\]</span></p>
<p>These terms can be combined by adding them, but first multiplying the second term by the regularization parameter <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>. We can then minimize the augmented error <span class="math">\(\augerror\)</span> where the bigger <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> is, the more insistent we are on smoothness versus fitting, as we have seen before on the topic of regularization.</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\sum_{n = 1}^N (h(x_n) - y_n)^2 + \lambda \sum_{k = 0}^\infty a_k \int_{-\infty}^\infty \left( \frac {d^k h} {dx^k} \right)^2 dx\]</span></p>
<p>If this is solved, we end up with <abbr title="Radial Basis Function">RBF</abbr>s, which means that with <abbr title="Radial Basis Function">RBF</abbr>s we are effectively looking for an interpolation, specifically as smooth an interpolation as possible in the sense of the sum of the squares of the derivatives with these coefficients. It isn’t surprising, therefore, that the best interpolation would be Gaussian. This is what gives <abbr title="Radial Basis Function">RBF</abbr>s credibility as inherently self-regularized.</p>
<h1 id="three-learning-principles">Three Learning Principles</h1>
<h2 id="occams-razor">Occam’s Razor</h2>
<p>Occam’s razor is a symbolic principle set by William of Occam, where we have a razor and we keep trimming the explanation to the bare minimum that is still consistent with the data, which happens to be the best possible explanation. More succinctly, it says that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The simplest model that fits the data is also the most plausible.</p>
<p><cite><strong>Occam’s Razor</strong> applied to ML</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s therefore important to know when a model is considered “simple,” and for this purpose there are two main types of complexity measures: one being the complexity of the hypothesis <span class="math">\(h\)</span> (object), the second being the complexity of the hypothesis set <span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span> (set of objects).</p>
<p>The complexity of <span class="math">\(h\)</span> can be measured using minimum description length (<abbr title="Minimum Description Length">MDL</abbr>) or the order of the polynomial. <abbr title="Minimum Description Length">MDL</abbr> concerns specifying an object with as few bits as possible, the fewer the bits, the “simpler” the object. For example, for a million-digit number we want to determine the complexity of individual numbers of that length. If we choose the number <span class="math">\(2^{1,000,000} - 1\)</span>, which is a million digits long, all the number <span class="math">\(9\)</span>. Despite the fact that this is a very long number, it’s simple because we can simply describe it as <span class="math">\(2^{1,000,000} - 1\)</span>, which isn’t a very long description. The order of the polynomial as a measure of complexity is straightforward.</p>
<p>The complexity of <span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span> can be measured using entropy and the <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension. The <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension produces a number that describes the diversity of the set, which is considered the complexity.</p>
<p>When we think of “simple”, we think in terms of a single object, <span class="math">\(h\)</span> in this case. However, proofs use “simple” in terms of <span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span>.</p>
<p>The complexity of an object and a set of objects are related, if not almost identical. For example, using the <abbr title="Minimum Description Length">MDL</abbr> we take <span class="math">\(l\)</span> bits to specify the object <span class="math">\(h\)</span>, in other words, the complexity of <span class="math">\(h\)</span> is <span class="math">\(l\)</span> bits. This implies that <span class="math">\(h\)</span> is one of <span class="math">\(2^l\)</span> elements of a set <span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span>, in other words, one of <span class="math">\(2^l\)</span> is the complexity of set <span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span>. Put into words, <strong>the link is</strong> that something is complex on its own if it’s one of many, whereas something is simple on its own if it’s one of few.</p>
<p>The link holds with respect to real-valued parameters (as opposed to bits), such as a 17th-order polynomial, which is considered complex because it is one of very many, since there are 17 parameters to tune.</p>
<p>There are exceptions. Support vector machines look complex but is one of few, i.e. when we go into an infinite-dimensional space yet only need a few support vectors to represent the separating hyperplane.</p>
<h3 id="puzzle-1-football-oracle">Puzzle 1: Football Oracle</h3>
<p>You get a letter Monday morning predicting the outcome of Monday night’s game. After we watch the game, we realize the letter was right. The same thing happens next Monday, even with the odds stacked against the team it called. This went on for 5 weeks in a row. On the 6th week, the letter asks you if you want to continue getting predictions for a $50 fee. Should you pay?</p>
<p>We shouldn’t. The guy isn’t sending only to us, but to 32 other people. In the first game, to half of those people he said the home team would lose, and the other half that they would win. The home team lost that first week. The second week, he did the same thing with the half of the recipients for which he sent the correct result. He repeated this process for 5 weeks until there was only one person left for him all “predictions” were correct.</p>

<p>We thought that the prediction ability was great since we only saw our letters (and we are the last remaining recipient for which all predictions were “correct”). We figured there was one hypothesis, and it predicted perfectly. The problem is that the hypothesis set is actually very complex, so the prediction value is meaningless, we simply didn’t know since we didn’t see the hypothesis set.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-simpler-better">Why is Simpler Better?</h3>
<p>Occam’s Razor isn’t making the statement that simpler is more elegant. Instead, Occam’s Razor is making the statement that simpler will have better out-of-sample performance.</p>
<p>The basic argument to back up this claim, which is a formal proof under different idealized conditions, is as follows. There are fewer simpler hypotheses than complex ones, which was captured by the growth function <span class="math">\(\growthfunc(N)\)</span>. To recap, the growth function took as parameter the size <span class="math">\(N\)</span> of the data set and returned the number of different patterns (dichotomies) that the hypothesis set <span class="math">\(\mathcal H\)</span> could generate on those <span class="math">\(N\)</span> points. Since there are fewer simpler hypotheses, it is less likely to fit a given data set, specifically, <span class="math">\(\growthfunc(N)/2^N\)</span>. Since it is less likely for fitting to occur, then when it does occur it is more significant.</p>
<p>The only difference between someone believing in the scam in Puzzle #1 and someone having the big picture was the fact that the growth function, from our point of view, was <span class="math">\(\growthfunc(N) = 1\)</span>—we are only one person, he has one hypothesis, and it was correct, and we gave it a lot of value since that scenario is unlikely to occur. The reality was that the growth function was <span class="math">\(\growthfunc(N) = 2^N\)</span>, which means it’s certain to happen, so that when it <em>does</em> happen, it’s meaningless.</p>
<h3 id="meaningless-fit">Meaningless Fit</h3>
<p>Suppose two scientists conduct an experiment to determine if conductivity is linear in the temperature. The first scientist is in a hurry so he simply takes two points from the data set and draws a line to connect them. The second scientist took three points and also drew a line. What evidence does the first or second experiment provide for the hypothesis that conductivity is linear in the temperature?</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 10px">
<img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/three-learning-principles/experiment-a.png"> <img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/three-learning-principles/experiment-b.png">
</div>
<p>Clearly the experiment that used three points to fit the line provided more evidence than the other. The experiment that used two points provided no evidence at all, because two points can always be connected by a line. This introduces the notion of <em>falsifiability</em>: if your data has no chance of falsifying your assertion, then it doesn’t provide any evidence for the assertion. We have to have a chance to falsify the assertion in order to be able to draw the evidence (axiom of non-falsifiability).</p>
<p>For example, the linear model is <em>too complex</em> for the data set size of <span class="math">\(N = 2\)</span> to be able to generalize at all, so there is no evidence. On the other hand, with a data set size of <span class="math">\(N = 3\)</span> the assertion could’ve been falsified if one of the three points was not collinear with the other two.</p>

<h2 id="sampling-bias">Sampling Bias</h2>
<h3 id="puzzle-2-presidential-election">Puzzle 2: Presidential Election</h3>
<p>In 1948, in the first presidential election after WW2 ended up in a close race between Truman and Dewey. A newspaper ran a phone poll asking people how they voted and concluded that Dewey had won the poll decisively, that is, he won above the error bar. They then printed a newspaper declaring “<em>Dewey Defeats Truman</em>.” However, Truman was the candidate that ended up winning.</p>
<p>This wasn’t <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>’s fault, where <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> was the discrepancy between in-sample (poll) and out-of-sample (general population), where we asked ourselves for the probability that this discrepancy is larger than some quantity <span class="math">\(\epsilon\)</span> such that the result was flipped:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\mathbb P \left[ |\insample - \outsample| \gt \epsilon \right] \leq \delta\]</span></p>
<p>It was not bad luck, however, because if they had run the poll again with a larger and larger sample size, they would’ve gotten the same result. The problem was that there was a <em>sampling bias</em> in the poll they conducted, and that is that in 1948, phones were expensive, and in that era, rich people favored Dewey more than they favored Truman.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the data is sampled in a biased way, then learning will produce a similarly biased outcome.</p>
<p><cite><strong>Sampling Bias Principle</strong></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This presents a problem of making sure that the data is representative of what we want. For example, in financial forecasting, we may want to predict the market by taking periods of the market where the market was normal. If this model is then tested in the real market which contains non-normal conditions, we will have no idea how the model will perform in those conditions.</p>
<h3 id="matching-the-distributions">Matching the Distributions</h3>
<p>The idea is that we have a distribution on the input space in our mind. Remember that <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr>, Hoeffding’s, etc. made the assumption that we chose the points for training from the same distribution that we picked for testing. One method, in principle, that might resolve this is to make the training set we have be more representative of the target set. This can be done by resampling from the training set by picking data points that better represent the target set, or by scaling the weights of the training points. This could mean that the effective size of the training set decreases, losing some of the independence of the points.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/three-learning-principles/matching-the-distributions.png" class="center"></p>
<p>This method doesn’t work if there is a region in the input space where the probability <span class="math">\(P = 0\)</span> for training (nothing will be sampled from this region) but <span class="math">\(P &gt; 0\)</span> (it’s being tested anyways). This is similar to the people without phones in Puzzle #2, who had <span class="math">\(P = 0\)</span> in the sample (they weren’t in the sample) but not in the general population (there were people without phones who voted).</p>
<h3 id="puzzle-3-credit-approval">Puzzle 3: Credit Approval</h3>
<p>A bank wants to approve credit automatically by going through the historical records of previous applicants who were given credit cards with 3-4 years of credit behavior. The input is the information they provided on the credit application, since this is the data that would be available from a new customer:</p>
<table>

<tr class="odd">

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The target is whether or not the person was profitable for the bank. For example, someone flirting with disaster who maxed out but paid the debt was profitable as long as they didn’t default.</p>
<p>The sampling bias lies in the fact that we’re only considering the historical data of customers we <em>approved</em>, since they’re the only ones for whom we have credit behavior data on. When we’re done training, we’ll have a system that applies to a new applicant, and we don’t know beforehand whether or not they’ll be approved or not, because they were never part of our training sample. In this case, sampling bias isn’t entirely terrible, because banks tend to be aggressive in providing credit, since borderline credit users are very profitable.</p>
<h2 id="data-snooping">Data Snooping</h2>
<p>The data snooping principle doesn’t forbid us from doing anything, it simply makes us realize that if we use a particular data set—the whole, subset, or something else—to navigate and decide which model, <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>, etc., then when we have an outcome from the learning process and we use the same data set that affected the choice of the learning process, the ability to fairly assess the performance of the outcome has been compromised by the fact that it was chosen according to the data set.</p>

<p>This is the most common trap for practitioners. A possible reason is that, when we data snoop, we end up with better performance—or so we think. Data snooping isn’t only looking at the data, in fact there are many ways to fall into the trap.</p>
<h3 id="looking-at-the-data">Looking at the Data</h3>
<p>The most common data snooping is “looking at the data.” For example, with non-linear transforms, we use a second-order transform:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\mathbf z = (1, x_1, x_2, x_1 x_2, x_1^2, x_2^2)\]</span></p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/three-learning-principles/looking-at-the-data.png" class="center"></p>
<p>We manage to get <span class="math">\(\insample = 0\)</span>, so we decide that we fit the problem very well but we don’t like the ratio of parameters-to-data points, with respect to generalization. So we decide that we could’ve done with a simpler transformation:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\mathbf z = (1, x_1^2, x_2^2) \text { or even } \mathbf z = (1, x_1^2 + x_2^2)\]</span></p>
<p>The problem is that this process of refining the non-linear transformation is essentially a learning algorithm, and we didn’t take into account the fact that we did some of the learning, and thereby forgot to charge the original <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension instead of just the final <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension of the non-linear transformation we arrived at.</p>
<p>It’s important to realize that the snooping in this example involves the data set <span class="math">\(\mathcal D\)</span>. The danger of looking at the data set is that we are vulnerable to designing the model or choices in learning according to the idiosyncrasies of the data set, so we are working well <em>on that</em> data set, but we don’t know how we’ll be doing in another independently generated data set from the same distribution, which would be the out-of-sample.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we’re completely allowed—encouraged, <em>ordered</em>—to look at all other information related to the target function and input space, <em>except for</em> the realization of the data set that we’re going to use for training, <em>unless</em> we’re going to charge accordingly. For example, we may ask: how many inputs do we have, what is the range of the inputs, how did we measure the inputs, are they physically correlated, do we know of any properties that we can apply. This is all valid and important for us to zoom-in correctly, since we’re not using the data, and are therefore not subject to overfitting the data. Instead we’re using properties of the target function and input space and therefore improving our chances of picking the correct model. <strong>The problem starts</strong> when we look at the data set and <em>not</em> charge accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="puzzle-4-financial-forecasting">Puzzle 4: Financial Forecasting</h3>
<p>Suppose we want to predict the exchange rate between the US Dollar versus the British Pound. We have 8 years worth of daily trading—about 2,000 data points. Our input-to-output model, where <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is the rate, can be expressed as getting the change in rate for the past 20 days, hoping that a particular pattern in the exchange rate will make it more likely that today’s change is positive or negative and by how much:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\Delta r_{-20}, \Delta r_{-19}, \dots, \Delta r_{-1} \to \Delta r_0\]</span></p>
<p>We normalize the data to zero-mean and unit-variance, we split randomly into a <span class="math">\(\trainingset\)</span> of 1,500 points and <span class="math">\(\def \testingset {\mathcal D_{\text {test}}}\)</span> and 500 points. The training set is 1,500 days so that for every day (output) we take the previous 20 days as the input. We completely locked away the <span class="math">\(\testingset\)</span> until it was time to test, in an effort to avoid data snooping, resulting in:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/three-learning-principles/financial-forecasting.png" class="center"></p>
<p>The plot is of the profit that the testing measure represents, which can be seen to be increasing with more and more days that are trained. When we attempt to try this live on the real market, we end up losing a lot money. The fact is that there was actually data snooping in this learning process: <strong>when we normalized the data</strong>. The problem is that we did this <em>before</em> we separated the data set into <span class="math">\(\trainingset\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\testingset\)</span>, so we took into consideration the mean and variance <em>of the test set</em>.</p>
<p>If we instead split the data first, then only normalized the <span class="math">\(\trainingset\)</span> and then took the <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\sigma^2\)</span> that did the normalization for the training set and applied those to the <span class="math">\(\testingset\)</span> so that they live in the same range of values and then reran the test, we would’ve gotten the blue line.</p>
<p>To recap, there’s <strong>nothing wrong with normalization</strong>, as long as the normalization parameters are extracted exclusively from the training set.</p>
<h3 id="data-set-reuse">Data Set Reuse</h3>
<p>If we try one model after another <strong>on the same data set</strong>, we will eventually “succeed.” The problem is that in doing this, we’re increasing the <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension without realizing it, since the final model that we end up using in order to learn is <strong>the union of all of the attempted models</strong>. Think of the <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension of the <em>total</em> learning model.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center">
If you torture the data long enough, it will confess.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This problem could occur not only due to the different models that we have attempted, but <em>also</em> due to what <strong><em>others</em></strong> have attempted. Imagine we decide to try our methods on some data set and we avoid looking at it. We decide to read papers about other people who have used the data set. In the end, we may not have looked at the data ourselves, but we used something that was affected by the data: the papers that others wrote. So that even if we only determined a couple of parameters and yielded great performance, we can’t simply conclude that we have a <abbr title="Vapnik-Chervonenkis">VC</abbr> dimension of 2 and 7,000 data points and that we’ll do great out of sample. This is because we don’t <em>only</em> have 2 parameters, but all of the decisions that led up to that model.</p>
<p>The key problem is that we’re matching a <strong><em>particular</em></strong> data set too well; we’re married to the data set, so that a completely new data set generated from the same distribution will look completely foreign to the model we created.</p>
<p>For example, the observation that, in the original data set, whenever a particular pair of points is close, there is always another point on the same line far away—this is clearly an idiosyncrasy of the data set, so that it would be pointless to try to find it in another data set from the same distribution since we may assume that if doesn’t exhibit this same quality, it must be from another distribution. The truth is that the data set is generated from the same distribution, it’s just that we got too used to the data set to the point where we were fitting the noise.</p>
<h3 id="data-snooping-remedies">Remedies</h3>
<p>There are two remedies to data snooping: avoiding it or accounting for it. Avoiding it naturally requires very strict discipline. Accounting for data snooping concerns keeping track of how much data contamination has occurred on each data set. The most vulnerable part is looking at the data, because it’s very difficult to model ourselves and say what is the hypothesis set that we explored in order to come up with a particular model by looking at the data.</p>
<h3 id="puzzle-5-bias-via-snooping">Puzzle 5: Bias via Snooping</h3>
<p>We’re testing the long-term performance of a famous strategy in trading called “buy and hold” in stocks. We use 50 years worth of data. We want the test to be as broad as possible so we take all currently traded companies in S&amp;P500. We assume that we strictly followed a buy and hold for all of them. We determine that the model will yield very great profits.</p>
<p>There is a sampling bias because we only looked at the <em>currently</em> traded stocks, which obviously excludes those that were around within the 50-year data span but are no longer traded.</p>
<p>People tend to treat this sampling bias not as sampling bias but as data snooping, because we looked at the future to see which stocks would be traded at that point. We consider it a sampling bias caused by “snooping.”</p>
<h1 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h1>
<h2 id="map-of-machine-learning">Map of Machine Learning</h2>
<p>Singular value decomposition would treat the Netflix problem as decomposing the canonical ratings matrix into two matrices (user and movie factors). Graphical Models are models for where the target is a joint probability distribution, they try to find computational efficient ways using graph algorithms to determine the joint probability distribution by means of simplifying the graph. Aggregation is when different solutions are combined.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/epilogue/ml-map.png" class="center"></p>
<h2 id="bayesian-learning">Bayesian Learning</h2>
<p>Bayesian learning tries to take a full probabilistic approach to learning. For example, going back to the learning diagram, we can observe that there are many probabilistic components. An inherent probabilistic component is the fact that the target can be noisy, which is why we don’t model the target as a function but rather as a probability distribution. This is apparent in the case of trying to predict heart attacks. Another probability distribution that we had to deal with was the unknown input probability distribution.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/epilogue/learning-diagram.png" class="center"></p>
<p>With the Bayesian approach, we want to extend the probabilistic role completely to all components, so that everything is a joint probability distribution. In the case of the heart attack prediction, we were trying to pick the hypothesis by determining the likelihood that that hypothesis would generate the data set in question:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[P(\mathcal D \mid h = f)\]</span></p>
<p>Bayesian approaches instead try to determine the hypothesis by considering the probability that a given hypothesis is the best one given the data:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[P(h = f \mid \mathcal D)\]</span></p>
<p>To compute this probability, we still need one more probability distribution:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
P(h = f \mid \mathcal D) = \frac {P(\mathcal D \mid h = f) P(h = f)} {P(\mathcal D)}
\propto P(\mathcal D \mid h = f) P(h = f)
\]</span></p>
<p>The probability <span class="math">\(P(\mathcal D \mid h = f)\)</span> can be computed the same way as in logistic regression, and the probability <span class="math">\(P(\mathcal D)\)</span> can also be computed by simply integrating out what we don’t want from the joint probability distribution in order to end up with the marginal <span class="math">\(P(\mathcal D)\)</span>. In fact, since we’re only picking the hypothesis according to the aforementioned criteria, we don’t really care about <span class="math">\(P(\mathcal D)\)</span> since it only scales the value up or down, and instead we can only worry about picking the hypothesis that yields the largest numerator.</p>
<p>The quantity that we don’t know is the <em>prior</em>: <span class="math">\(P(h = f)\)</span>, that is, the probability that the current hypothesis is the target function. It’s called the prior because it’s our belief of the hypothesis set before we got any data. We can modify this value after we get the data to get the <em>posterior</em>: <span class="math">\(P(h = f \mid \mathcal D)\)</span>, which is more informed based on the data.</p>
<p>Given the prior, we have the full distribution. For example, consider a perceptron <span class="math">\(h\)</span> determined by <span class="math">\(\weight = w_0, w_1, \dots, w_d\)</span>. A possible prior on <span class="math">\(\weight\)</span> can take into account the fact that the magnitude of the weights doesn’t matter, so that each weight <span class="math">\(w_i\)</span> is independent and uniform over <span class="math">\([-1, 1]\)</span>. This determines the prior over <span class="math">\(h\)</span>, <span class="math">\(P(h = f)\)</span>. Given <span class="math">\(\mathcal D\)</span>, we can compute <span class="math">\(P(\mathcal D \mid h = f)\)</span>. Putting them together we get <span class="math">\(P(h = f \mid \mathcal D) \propto P(h = f)P(\mathcal D \mid h = f)\)</span>.</p>
<p>This shows that the prior is an assumption. Even the most “neutral” prior for an unknown number <span class="math">\(x\)</span> for which we only know that it is between <span class="math">\(-1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(+1\)</span>. It might seem reasonable to want to model this using a uniform probability distribution from <span class="math">\(-1\)</span> to <span class="math">\(+1\)</span>. This seems reasonable because it’s as likely to be any value in that range.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/epilogue/prior-1.png" class="center"></p>
<p>However, consider that using that model, if we were to take a bunch of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>’s and average them, we’d get something close to <span class="math">\(0\)</span>. However, in the unknown case, we have no idea what value we’d get from this operation. In fact, we can even say how close it’d be to zero in terms of variance.</p>
<p>In fact, the true equivalent would be the image below, where the probability distribution is a delta function centered on a point <span class="math">\(a\)</span> that we don’t know. Choosing to model the situation with the uniform probability distribution results in a huge building based on false premises.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/epilogue/prior-2.png" class="center"></p>
<p>If we actually knew the prior then we could compute the posterior <span class="math">\(P(h = f \mid \mathcal D)\)</span> for every hypothesis <span class="math">\(h \in \mathcal H\)</span>. With this, we could find the most probable hypothesis given the data. In fact, we can derive the expected value of <span class="math">\(h\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mathbb E(h(\feature))\)</span> for every <span class="math">\(\feature\)</span>. Further still, we can derive the <em>error bar</em>—the chances that we’re wrong. Simply, we can derive everything in a principled way.</p>
<p>Bayesian learning can be justified in two main cases. The first is when the prior is <em>valid</em>, that is, it is indeed the probability that a particular hypothesis is the target function. The second is when the prior is <em>irrelevant</em>, for example, when we place a prior, when get more and more data sets and we look at the posterior we might realize that the posterior is affected largely by the data set and less by the prior; the prior gets factored out as we get more and more data. In this case, we can think of the prior simply as a computational catalyst.</p>
<p>For example, we might choose to use conjugate priors, where we don’t have to recompute the posterior as an entire function, but instead parameterize it and change the parameters when we get new data points. This is valid when we’re going to be doing it enough that by the time we arrive, it doesn’t matter what we started with.</p>
<h2 id="aggregation-methods">Aggregation Methods</h2>
<p>Aggregation is a method that applies to all models, which combines different solutions <span class="math">\(h_1, h_2, \dots, h_T\)</span> that were trained on <span class="math">\(\mathcal D\)</span>. In the image below, every node corresponds to a resultant system <span class="math">\(h_i\)</span> that each person trained.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/epilogue/aggregation-1.png" class="center"></p>
<p>For example, when trying to detect a face with computer vision, we can instead detect components related to a face, such as an eye, nose, are the positions of these relative to each other, etc. If we were to try to determine whether or not a face was detected from just one of these features, the error would be large. However, if these are combined correctly, we might perform better. This is important in computer vision because we want to perform at or near real-time, so it helps to base the decision on simple computations.</p>
<p>If the problem is a <em>regression</em>, then we can combine the results by simply taking an average. If the problem is a <em>classification</em>, then we can take a vote.</p>
<p>Aggregation is also known as <em>ensemble learning</em> and <em>boosting</em>.</p>
<p>This is <strong>different</strong> from performing 2-layer learning. For example, in a 2-layer model such as a neural network with one hidden layer, all units learn <em>jointly</em>. In the case of the neural network, each of the nodes are updated jointly via back-propagation. A single node isn’t trying to replicate the function, it’s just trying to contribute positively to the function:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/epilogue/aggregation-2.png" class="center"></p>
<p>In the case of aggregation, the units learn <em>independently</em>—as if they were the only unit. In the image below, each node is trying to replicate the function individually. Their outputs are then combined to get the output:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/epilogue/aggregation-3.png" class="center"></p>
<h3 id="before-the-fact">Before the Fact</h3>
<p>Aggregation before the fact creates the solutions with a view to the fact that they will be combined, such that they will “blend well” together. An example of this is <em>bagging</em>, where we’re given the data set and we resample it so that every solution uses a different bootstrap sample, in order to introduce some independence.</p>
<p>In fact, instead leaving the decorrelation to chance, we can enforce it. We can build each hypothesis by making sure that what it covers is different from what other hypotheses cover. This is done by creating each of the hypotheses <span class="math">\(h_1, \dots, h_t, \dots\)</span> sequentially, making each hypothesis <span class="math">\(h_t\)</span> decorrelated with previous hypotheses. That is, after the third hypothesis for example, we consider what the best fourth hypothesis would be to add to the mix such that it is sufficiently different from the previous other three. This is accomplished by analyzing how the previous three performed, and based on that performance, providing a data set to the fourth hypothesis so that it develops something fairly independent from the previous three.</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes/machine-learning/epilogue/aggregation-4.png" class="center"></p>
<p>For example, consider that the hypothesis functions that exist so far, combined, can correctly classify 60% of the data points in the set. In order to make the new hypothesis fairly independent from the existing ones, we can emphasize those points on which we performed poorly by giving them larger weights and conversely deemphasize those we got right, such that it looks like 50-50 so that the weighted error is 50%. If we take this distribution and learn on it with the new hypothesis and do better than 50%, then the new hypothesis is adding value to what we had before.</p>
<p>In effect, we choose the weight of <span class="math">\(h_t\)</span> based on <span class="math">\(\insample(h_t)\)</span>. The most famous algorithm that specifies this behavior is <em>adaptive boosting</em> AKA <em>AdaBoost</em>.</p>
<h3 id="after-the-fact">After the Fact</h3>
<p>Aggregation <strong>after the fact</strong> combines existing solutions. This is what happened when the Netflix teams merged, “blending.” For regression problems we might have solutions <span class="math">\(h_1, h_2, \dots, h_T\)</span>, and we might combine the solutions using some coefficients <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> such that:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[g(\feature) = \sum_{t = 1}^T \alpha_t h_t(\feature)\]</span></p>
<p>To determine the optimal <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> coefficients, we can minimize the error on a separate “aggregation data set.” The pseudo-inverse can be used for this purpose. It’s important to emphasize that we should use a clean set for the aggregation data set. When this is done, some coefficients may come out negative, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that the solution is bad and is being rid of. It could be that the solution is particularly correlated with another, and so the system is trying to combine them in order to get the signal without the noise.</p>
<p>In that case, how can we determine the most valuable hypothesis in the blend? This can be determined by determining the performance with and without a particular hypothesis, where the difference between these two values corresponds to the contribution of that hypothesis to the blend.</p>
