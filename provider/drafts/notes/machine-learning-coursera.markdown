These are separate notes from the [other machine learning notes](/notes/machine-learning/) which are based off of Cal Tech's [CS 1156x](https://www.edx.org/course/caltechx/cs1156x/learning-data/1120) by Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa. These notes are about Stanford's [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml) class by Andrew Ng. I decided to separate them to make it easier on me, since I'm taking both concurrently. I intend to merge them eventually.
