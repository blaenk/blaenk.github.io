This page lists some of the things I've been up to lately.

## Working On

* A game I've been wanting to work on for a while now. It's being developed with CMake, C++11, LuaJIT, and architected from the beginning to facilitate cross-platform development.

* An audio player, though it'll ultimately be used for something else other than general audio playback. I'm decoding audio frames using [ffmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org/)'s libavcodec, libavformat, libavutil, and libswresample. Playback is currently done using [PulseAudio](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio) although I intend to switch to a cross-platform library like [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/). It works with any format/container/codec supported by ffmpeg. Source will be up soon. **Update**: Ported to [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/), now runs on Windows!

## Reading

This is what I'm currently reading, but I also keep a list of [books I've read](/reads).

* [Mistborn: The Final Empire](http://amzn.com/0765350386) --- After finishing [_The Way of Kings_][wok] and absolutely _loving_ it, I decided to try another series within the same universe (the universe is called _The Cosmere_), called _Mistborn_. I decided to do this while I wait for the second book of the _Stormlight Archive_ series, _Words of Radiance_, which comes out on March 4, 2014.

    This book starts out a lot darker than tWoK, although there are actually a lot of parallels once you learn about a plot twist reveal towards the end of tWoK. The world in general is more somber though. The world seems split between the aristocracy and a slave class known as the _skaa_. The slave class has for the most part lost all hope after centuries of subjugation.

    It appears that membership into these classes is determined by a great war that occurred centuries ago. The leader of the winning side, the Lord Ruler, is apparently immortal and he rewarded all of those that fought for him, and their descendants, by making them members of the aristocracy.

    The aristocracy was also rewarded with genes that give them the ability to wield special powers, but very few nobles are actually born with these powers. "Half-bloods" between the aristocracy and the skaa are forbidden and hunted down. There are different kinds of powers, and they're all triggered by consuming certain metals, depending on the power, and "burning" them. Those born with the powers actually only manifest the ability to wield one of these powers, those people are referred to as _Mistings_. Even rarer are those who can wield all of the powers, known as _Mistborns_. That is, it's no powers, one power, or all powers.

* [A Guerra dos Tronos](http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Game_of_Thrones) --- The Portuguese translation of Game of Thrones, the first book in the [A Song of Ice and Fire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire) series (pt: As Cr√¥nicas de Gelo e Fogo).
	
	Even during my first read-through of all five books that are currently out, I had intended to re-read the series in a different language. A friend is currently listening to the audiobook, so I decided now was as good a time as any to start. I have always wanted to learn a bit of Portuguese, so I looked around and found the whole set of books for my Kindle.

	The Portuguese text renders nicely on the Kindle and all, but it'd make the reading process a lot more efficient if I could substitute the English dictionary with a Portuguese-to-English dictionary for when I get stuck on a word that I can't resolve using context clues or Spanish and French.

## Studying

* Statistics: Three courses offered by UC Berkeley covering [descriptive statistics](https://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeley/stat2-1x/introduction-statistics/594), [probabilities](https://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeley/stat2-2x/introduction-statistics/685), and [inference](https://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeley/stat2-3x/introduction-statistics/825). I'm taking them to freshen up on the subjects, to reinforce my foundation for understanding machine learning.

* [Parallel Programming with GPUs](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs344): A class that teaches GPGPU programming using [CUDA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA).

*[GRRM]: George RR Martin
*[GPGPU]: General Purpose GPU
