This page lists some of the things I've been up to lately.

## Working On

* A game I've been wanting to work on for a while now. It's being developed with CMake, C++11, LuaJIT, and architected from the beginning to facilitate cross-platform development.

* An audio player, though it'll ultimately be used for something else other than general audio playback. I'm decoding audio frames using [ffmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org/)'s libavcodec, libavformat, libavutil, and libswresample. Playback is currently done using [PulseAudio](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio) although I intend to switch to a cross-platform library like [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/). It works with any format/container/codec supported by ffmpeg. Source will be up soon. **Update**: Ported to [PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/), now runs on Windows!

## Reading

This is what I'm currently reading, but I also keep a list of [books I've read](/reads).

* [Words of Radiance](http://amzn.com/0765326361) --- This is the much anticipated sequel to [The Way of Kings] and the second book in the 10-book epic fantasy _Stormlight Archive_. It starts out with an alternate perspective on the event that catalyzed the events of tWoK. All of the characters --- which were previously scattered throughout the world --- are finally converging upon the same location, ramping up anticipation of their first interactions.

    The magic that was misunderstood and scarce during the first book is slowly becoming more common, and some of the more scholarly characters are attempting to study it.
    
    Sanderson is known to be a very prolific writer, writing thousands of words every day, teaching a university class on creative writing, and has had enough practice with world-building and meticulous story planning with _Mistborn_, the last few books of _Wheel of Time_, and various other independent books he has written. This is what he wants to be his legacy, what he has prepared for, and it really shows.

* [Mistborn: The Hero of Ages](http://amzn.com/0765356147) --- This is the sequel to [The Well of Ascension] and the third and final book in the original _Mistborn_ trilogy. The end of the second book completely changed the stakes of the world and now the characters must deal with the repercussions.

    The world and characters are very different from how they were in the first book. By now the characters have been really developed from the events of the past two books and are efficiently and expertly attempting to deal with a problem that otherwise seems insurmountable to them. Meanwhile, those characters that seemed to have reached the extent of their development have experienced events that have catalyzed further development in ways that would seem uncharacteristic of how we knew them to be.

    This is a very beautiful series. It has been tragic, nerve-racking, deep, funny, and heartwarming. There is a recurrent theme of attempting the impossible, of perseverance and determination in the face of apparently unequivocal doom. Of survival.

* [A Guerra dos Tronos](http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Game_of_Thrones) --- The Portuguese translation of Game of Thrones, the first book in the [A Song of Ice and Fire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire) series (pt: As Cr√¥nicas de Gelo e Fogo).

    Even during my first read-through of all five books that are currently out, I had intended to re-read the series in a different language. A friend is currently listening to the audiobook, so I decided now was as good a time as any to start. I have always wanted to learn a bit of Portuguese, so I looked around and found the whole set of books for my Kindle.

    The Portuguese text renders nicely on the Kindle and all, but it'd make the reading process a lot more efficient if I could substitute the English dictionary with a Portuguese-to-English dictionary for when I get stuck on a word that I can't resolve using context clues or Spanish and French.

## Studying

* Statistics: Three courses offered by UC Berkeley covering [descriptive statistics](https://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeley/stat2-1x/introduction-statistics/594), [probabilities](https://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeley/stat2-2x/introduction-statistics/685), and [inference](https://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeley/stat2-3x/introduction-statistics/825). I'm taking them to freshen up on the subjects, to reinforce my foundation for understanding machine learning.

* [Parallel Programming with GPUs](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs344): A class that teaches GPGPU programming using [CUDA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA).

*[GRRM]: George RR Martin
*[GPGPU]: General Purpose GPU
