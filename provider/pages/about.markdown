My name is Jorge Israel Peña, though online I sometimes use the pseudonym Blaenk Denum. I'm a developer currently living in Southern California. I speak English, Spanish, French, and am trying to learn Portuguese.

My interests include [Haskell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)), C and [C++11](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11), the [POSIX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) standards and the Linux Programming Interface, [LLVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM), [Digital Signal Processing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing) and [Music Visualization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_visualization), [Artificial Intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) and [Machine Learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), [Music Information Retrieval](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_information_retrieval), [Web Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development), [GPGPU Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_computing_on_graphics_processing_units), and [Real-Time Rendering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_rendering). I love to [read](/reads/) about these and other subjects.

## Technology

I try to be a [pragmatic programmer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer). I love to learn different technologies, most recently [Haskell and Digital Signal Processing](/posts/naive-convolution-in-haskell/). I do it because I have a genuine interest in gaining different perspectives on software development in order to maintain an open and malleable mind, with the hope that it'll help to prepare me for future technological disruptions.

While I do take pride in my work, I don't waste time with being prideful. Instead I always defer to experience, but I ensure that I achieve a proper understanding instead of [cargo culting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming).

I prefer to use the best tool for the job. For this reason I try to be agnostic when it comes to technologies: I'm open to any operating system, tool, language, and framework. But don't mistake this neutrality for indifference. I simply strive to appreciate the benefits of different technologies. Whenever possible, however, I prefer to use tools at which I'm already adept, such as [vim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)), [git](http://git-scm.com/), and a [POSIX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) environment.

Check out [this page](/uses-this) for more specifics on my preferences.

## Background

My family didn't have a computer before I was 12 years old. In fact, all of my life I had largely avoided computers, aside from specific instances in school when we were given time to work with them. This was a natural result of being warned and scolded not to play around with computers lest I break them.

However, by the age of 11 I was at a point in school where computers were a necessity. Without a computer, I usually had to go to the library to type up school assignments. This wasn't always possible on short-notice assignments, however. In these situations, I would have to write up assignments in ink, attempting to appease draconian requirements which demanded no mistakes at all -- no white-out allowed.

See, as the only student in their class without a computer capable of producing neatly printed assignments, I was inconveniencing _the teacher_. So while other students could lazily type up assignments in a matter of minutes, I had to meticulously obsess over my writing [^writing].

This led to late nights, many rewrites, and stress -- since I always cared for doing things right in school. I was tired of it, and somewhat embarrassed for not being "with the times," making me a bit economically self-conscious [^tma].

One day I was out on a construction job with my dad and noticed a computer ad magazine during lunch hour. Having nothing else to distract me, I began to read through it and naturally began to make connections between prices and components. This gave me an idea of which parts were absolutely crucial to a working computer and which weren't, which were the best parts for the money, and which places had them the cheapest.

Armed with this information, I made a deal with my dad which consisted of me maintaining good grades in school and going to work with him to help him out for a few months so that I may earn the money necessary for a cheap, custom built computer.

A few months of hard work later I went to a small computer shop I discovered in the ad magazine to purchase my first computer. Shortly afterward, I learned that software development was a "thing" and there began my insatiable interest in all related subjects [^window].

## Music

I love and have been listening to Electronic Dance Music for years, mainly Trance, which I primarily listen to by filtering various EDM radio shows for the best tracks. Shows I listen to are Armin van Buuren's [A State of Trance](http://www.astateoftrance.com/), Sander van Doorn's [Identity](http://www.sandervandoorn.com/radio/), and Tiësto's [Club Life](http://www.tiesto.com/Tiesto-club-life-podcasts).

While I primarily listen to EDM, I'm open to and enjoy a wide variety of music. I never really understood why some people hate on certain genres.

## Fitness

I work out religiously, every other day without fail, specifically doing strength training. I do [squats](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/BBFullSquat.html), [overhead presses](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/DeltoidAnterior/BBMilitaryPress.html), [bench presses](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/PectoralSternal/BBBenchPress.html), [deadlifts](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/ErectorSpinae/BBDeadlift.html), and [barbell rows](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/BackGeneral/BBBentOverRow.html). I don't do max weight during my work outs and instead opt for a natural weight increase progression. That said, while I originally began with an empty bar, at the time of writing I'm at 300 lbs. on squats, bench presses, and deadlifts. Overhead presses are at 155 lbs. Barbell rows are at 185 lbs.

[^writing]: This was at a school that required all writing to be in cursive. Ultimately I moved to another area where most people didn't even know how to write in cursive. I was relieved, but since then I've always been told that my print writing looks like cursive.
[^tma]: This school was in a pretty affluent area which I was not from. I was able to attend due to my grades and collaboration between faculty from both my previous school and this new school.
[^window]: I still remember the moment at which my curiosity sparked the question of how programs were created. I felt that I had some understanding of the basic functionality of various PC hardware components, but how was it that a window, with all of its buttons and functionality, came into existence?
