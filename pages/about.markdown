I'm Jorge Israel Peña, also known as Blaenk Denum. I currently live in Southern California and speak English, Spanish, and French.

My areas of interest are [Artificial Intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), [Machine Learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), and [Digital Signal Processing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing). More specifically, I'm interested in the combination of each of these fields in the interdisciplinary science of [Music Information Retrieval](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_information_retrieval), particularly for music visualization.

You can check out what I'm up to [lately](/lately) or find me on [github](http://github.com/blaenk) and [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/101090/jorge-israel-pena).

If you'd like to get in touch you can email me at jorgepblank@gmail.com [^1]

### Technology

I try to be a [pragmatic programmer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer). I love to learn different technologies, most recently [Haskell and Digital Signal Processing](/posts/naive-convolution-in-haskell/). I don't do it to be elitist or to jump on the latest bandwagon and be hip, but because I have a genuine interest in gaining different perspectives on software development in order to maintain an open and malleable mind. I think it'll help to prepare me for future technological disruptions.

While I do take pride in my work, I don't waste time with being prideful. Instead I always defer to experience, but I ensure a proper understanding instead of [cargo culting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming).

I prefer to use the best tool for the job. For this reason I try to be agnostic when it comes to technologies: I'm open to any operating system, tool, language, and framework. But don't mistake this neutrality for indifference. I simply strive to appreciate the benefits of different technologies. Whenever possible, however, I prefer to use tools at which I'm already adept, such as [vim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)), [git](http://git-scm.com/), and a [POSIX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) environment.

Check out [this page](/uses-this) for more specifics on my preferences.

### Music

I love and have been listening to Electronic Dance Music for years, mainly Trance, which I primarily listen to by filtering various EDM radio shows for the best tracks. Shows I listen to are Armin van Buuren's [A State of Trance](http://www.astateoftrance.com/), Sander van Doorn's [Identity](http://www.sandervandoorn.com/radio/), and Tiësto's [Club Life](http://www.tiesto.com/Tiesto-club-life-podcasts).

While I primarily listen to EDM, I'm open to and enjoy a wide variety of music. I never really understood why some people hate on certain genres.

### Fitness

I work out religiously, every other day without fail, specifically doing strength training. I do [squats](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Quadriceps/BBFullSquat.html), [overhead presses](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/DeltoidAnterior/BBMilitaryPress.html), [bench presses](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/PectoralSternal/BBBenchPress.html), [deadlifts](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/ErectorSpinae/BBDeadlift.html), and [barbell rows](http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/BackGeneral/BBBentOverRow.html). I don't do max weight during my work outs and instead opt for a natural weight increase progression. That said, while I originally began with an empty bar, at the time of writing I'm at 285 lbs. on squats, bench presses, and deadlifts. Overhead presses are at 145 lbs. Barbell rows are at 170 lbs.
