<p>At any moment I have a handful of books that I&#39;m currently reading. I find that I don&#39;t have trouble keeping track of each, thanks in part to keeping <a href="/notes/">notes</a>, and having a set of books allows me to switch to something else temporarily if a particular book falls into a lull. I also keep a page of reviews of <a href="/reads/">books that I&#39;ve finished</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/books/kingkiller2.jpg" class="right" width="128"></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://amzn.com/0756407125">The Wise Man&#39;s Fear</a> --- After finishing the <a href="/reads/#kingkiller1">first book in the series</a> and liking it enough, I decided to continue on to the sequel. Where Sanderson is well known for his so-called &quot;worldbuilding,&quot; Rothfuss is well known for his very beautiful prose. In a genre increasingly filled with books containing complex worlds and multiple POVs, <em>The Kingkiller Chronicle</em> is a refreshing change of pace.</p>

<p>In other books, the world-at-large is not really explored and is largely incidental; the aspects we glean about it are usually only those that are somehow related to the characters. This is only natural, but <em>Kingkiller Chronicle</em> is more or less a story about the everyday life of the main character, Kvothe. This affords a level of familiarity with the world that I haven&#39;t seen in other books that I&#39;ve read.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/books/bitcoin.jpg" class="right" width="128"></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://amzn.com/1449374042">Mastering Bitcoin</a> --- I just now began studying Bitcoin, but from the moment I learned of its existence I recognized that there was clearly something revolutionary about the fact that this was a decentralized monetary system which was used---and presumably by extension trusted---by people.</p>

<p>I continue to be amazed at the foresight of Satoshi and sheer ingenuity of the solutions employed in Bitcoin. This book---and Bitcoin in general---triggered an epiphany in me: I realized that cryptography can be used for more than just maintaining user privacy, but also as a way to enforce conformance with a system.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/books/onchina.jpg" class="right" width="128"></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://amzn.com/0143121316">On China</a> --- China has always interested me as seeming like a world within a world. I had previously seen some <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-sw12x-china-920">edX courses</a> about China that seemed to be <em>very</em> good, but I tend to prefer reading rather than watching when it comes to learning.</p>

<p>This book by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger">Henry Kissinger</a> goes over the historical perspective that informs China&#39;s current state of affairs. Henry Kissinger is the one that orchestrated the opening of relations with China when he served as Secretary of State during the Nixon Administration, so he&#39;s no stranger to the country. The book seems to go over parts of Chinese history chronologically leading up to modern day, and it is simply <em>engrossing</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/books/haskellconpar.jpg" class="right" width="128"></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://amzn.com/1449335942">Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell</a> [<a href="/notes/haskell/">notes</a>] --- It&#39;s well known that Haskell makes it very easy to reason about concurrent and parallel programs, and this has proven true in my experience so far. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory">software transactional memory</a> package provides transactional concurrency primitives that make writing safe, concurrent programs very simple.</p>

<p>One of the more common difficulties in reasoning about Haskell programs is the property of being non-strict, which in GHC is handled via lazy evaluation. What this means is that one has to be careful about how expressions are evaluated, particularly with <em>when</em> they will be evaluated. This is especially important in parallel evaluation contexts, where the parallel evaluation can end up only evaluating the expression to weak-head normal form, i.e. the outer-most constructor. For this reason, this book starts out with thorough coverage of so-called evaluation strategies, which decouple a given algorithm from the way in which it&#39;s to be evaluated (e.g. in parallel or not).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/books/erlang.jpg" class="right" width="128"></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://amzn.com/193778553X">Programming Erlang</a> [<a href="/notes/erlang/">notes</a>] --- Erlang was the first functional programming language I attempted to learn. The combination of foreign (to me) programming paradigm and actor concurrency model was enough to prevent me from seeing the bigger picture, and so I never finished learning it, instead opting for Haskell.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like to leave things like these unfinished, so now that I have a solid understanding of functional programming and the actor concurrency model, I&#39;m attempting to give Erlang a second chance. I don&#39;t particularly see myself using Erlang; I think Haskell is a superior language and Scala has access to a more vibrant and robust package ecosystem. However, Erlang and its OTP library are known to be very robust, so my intention with learning it is to see what ideas I can pick up from them.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/books/java.jpg" class="right" width="128"></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://amzn.com/0071808558">Java: The Complete Reference</a> --- I&#39;ve always &quot;known&quot; Java through my use of it in school where it was sometimes required, but I never formally learned it. With the release of Java 8 and the many new languages that are targeting the JVM, I felt it would be a good idea to sweep through a Java book to ensure that I understand the nook and crannies of Java.</p>

<p>I was specifically looking for a book that served more as a reference instead of a beginner-oriented book that which I would have to sift through to find the nuggets of actual information, past the exercises and code examples. This book seems well regarded and has so far served that purpose.</p></li>

</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Statistics: Three courses offered by UC Berkeley covering <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeley/stat2-1x/introduction-statistics/594">descriptive statistics</a>, <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeley/stat2-2x/introduction-statistics/685">probabilities</a>, and <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeley/stat2-3x/introduction-statistics/825">inference</a>. I&#39;m taking them to freshen up on the subjects, to reinforce my foundation for understanding machine learning.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs344">Parallel Programming with GPUs</a>: A class that teaches GPGPU programming using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA">CUDA</a>.</p></li>

<a href="#working-on" class="header-link">Working On</a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>A game I&#39;ve been wanting to work on for a while now. It&#39;s being developed with CMake, C++11, LuaJIT, and architected from the beginning to facilitate cross-platform development.</p></li>
<li><p>An audio player, though it&#39;ll ultimately be used for something else other than general audio playback. I&#39;m decoding audio frames using <a href="http://www.ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a>&#39;s libavcodec, libavformat, libavutil, and libswresample. Playback is currently done using <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio">PulseAudio</a> although I intend to switch to a cross-platform library like <a href="http://www.portaudio.com/">PortAudio</a>. It works with any format/container/codec supported by ffmpeg. Source will be up soon. <strong>Update</strong>: Ported to <a href="http://www.portaudio.com/">PortAudio</a>, now runs on Windows!</p></li>
